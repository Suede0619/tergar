**Re:** Today's conversation and next steps

---

Christy, Matt, Zak —

Thank you for the candid conversation today. We appreciated the directness and came away with a much sharper understanding of where Tergar Retreats stands and what you need from a partner.

Three things stuck with us:

**1. Brand foundation is the bottleneck.** Nothing else moves — not the website, not the collateral, not the campaign — until the narrative, voice, and positioning are locked. We agree completely. That's where we start, and it's where Mikyo's background in the lineage gives us an edge no other team can match.

**2. You need new audiences, not recycled ones.** With 1,000 CRM contacts and donor fatigue across the mandala, the path forward isn't squeezing more from the existing base. We've identified five net new segments — contemplative science, tech wealth, European wellness, displaced practitioners, and environmental philanthropy — that don't compete with any sister organization.

**3. Timeline needs to be realistic.** We heard Zak's feedback. We've revised our original 9-week plan to a 12-week timeline that builds in all 5 review rounds while still hitting March 31 grant-ready. Cost remains $25,000 for Phase 1.

We've put together a detailed summary document that addresses all ten concerns raised in the meeting, answers Matt's questions about capital campaign experience and the Web3 background, and makes the specific case for our team. We'd be grateful if you'd take the time to read it.

We're ready to start the moment you say go — kickoff workshop on the calendar within a week of signing.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

With respect and enthusiasm for the work,

Mikyo, Suede, and Ian
