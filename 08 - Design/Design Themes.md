## Photography Guidelines

**Style: "Authentic Presence"** - Natural light (golden hour), authentic moments, environmental context, diverse subjects, mix of intimate and expansive.

**Categories:**
- **Location (Portugal):** Landscapes, architectural details, construction progress, interiors, seasonal variation. Inviting, grounded.
- **Practice:** Individual/group meditation, retreat daily life, teacher leading. Genuine, unforced.
- **Teacher & Lineage:** Rinpoche (teaching, informal, portrait), senior teachers, historical lineage. Approachable wisdom.
- **Community:** Diverse practitioners, shared meals, gatherings, families. Warmth, belonging.
- **Science:** Brain imaging, research participants, data viz. Credible, human.

**Avoid:** Stock cliches, overly blissful imagery, exclusively white/Western practitioners, generic "wellness" aesthetics.

## Graphics & Visual Elements

**Icons:** Line-based (2-3px), rounded corners, 24x24 or 32x32 base. Sets needed: practice types, facilities, programs, features, practical, values. Traditional elements (dharma wheel, lotus, endless knot) simplified for modern use.

**Infographics:** Editorial quality, natural palette, clear hierarchy. Needed for: gift pyramid, funding timeline, impact metrics, path comparison, science findings.

**Patterns:** Nature (topographic lines, water ripples), traditional (simplified knot, geometric mandala), modern (gradient meshes, grids). Always subtle (5-10% opacity).

---

## Layout Principles

**Grid:** 12-column responsive, generous gutters (24-32px), max width 1200-1400px. Breakpoints: 1440, 1024, 768, 375.

**Composition:**
- Balance asymmetry with stability
- Embrace white space as openness
- Hierarchy through scale and position
- Consistent 8px spacing base

## Special Design Elements

2. **"Breath" Animation:** Subtle 4-6 second cycle, gentle scale/opacity, calming loading/transition states.
3. **"Journey" Graphic:** Path from curiosity to realization. Timeline with milestones for programs/campaign/construction.
4. **"Mandala" Structure:** Circular info architecture (center: Rinpoche, rings: levels). Interactive on web.
