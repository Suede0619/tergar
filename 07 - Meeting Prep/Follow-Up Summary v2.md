# Follow-Up: How We Solve Tergar's Problems

*January 27, 2026*

---

We heard ten concerns in today's meeting. Here's how we address each one — plus the two questions that didn't get fully answered.

---

## 1. Donor Fatigue & Net New Audiences

**The problem:** 1,000 CRM contacts. Multiple mandala orgs hitting the same people. You need entirely new segments.

**Five net new audience segments we will pursue:**

1. **Contemplative Science & Neuroscience.** The Dan Brown/John paper on three-year retreat brain changes, Rinpoche's Mind & Life connections — position Samadhi as the only Western retreat center where peer-reviewed neuroscience practice actually happens. Zero overlap with existing Tergar donor base.

2. **Tech & Crypto Wealth.** Matthew Zimwalt's Filecoin connections plus Mikyo's direct relationships with high-net-worth tech individuals interested in meditation and consciousness. Targeted cultivation track using existing networks.

3. **Western European Wellness Market.** 20-30% projected growth in 2026. Position Samadhi as "authentic practice without compromise" — the antidote to superficial wellness tourism. Target through European media, wellness publications, and aligned partnerships.

4. **Displaced Buddhist Practitioners.** Shambhala's institutional crisis left thousands of serious Western practitioners without a home. Tergar's ethical clarity and stable leadership make it the natural landing place. Messaging that speaks to this audience without exploiting the situation.

5. **Environmental & Rural Revitalization Philanthropists.** Sustainable design, local materials, rural Portuguese integration — a story for donors completely outside the Buddhist world.

None of these segments compete with Tergar International or Tergar Institute. A conventional nonprofit agency would recycle the same list. We open five new fronts.

---

## 2. Brand Identity — Who Is Tergar Retreats?

**The problem:** No brand narrative, no messaging framework, no voice guidelines. The Tergar name is known; Tergar Retreats is not.

**Our approach:** Isolated one-on-one stakeholder interviews (3-5 voices) — no groupthink. From discovery, we deliver:

- **Brand Positioning:** Tergar Retreats as *the practice brand* — where philosophy becomes embodied experience
- **Master Narrative:** Single source of truth adaptable for all audiences
- **Messaging Framework:** Audience-specific talking points (donors, grant officers, millennials, practitioners)
- **Voice Guidelines:** Distinct from International (educational) and Institute (scholarly) — warmer, more embodied, more grounded in place
- **Visual Identity Refinement:** Evolve the existing mandala design system — not reinvent it. More earth, more texture, more Portugal. Refinement, not revolution.

Mikyo grew up in the Nyingma/Kagyu lineage. He doesn't need onboarding to understand how dharma organizations talk to practitioners versus foundations. That fluency can't be hired — it has to be lived.

## 3. Credibility for Major Gift Fundraising

**The problem:** Donors need to see you have your act together before Christy can pitch seven figures.

**Phase 1 deliverables built for this:**

- **Donor Pitch Deck** — corporate-grade, VC-quality design, editable in Figma
- **Case for Support** (1-8 pages) — visual authority of a foundation annual report
- **Naming & Sponsorship Package** — dignified, clear recognition philosophy
- **Gift Pyramid Graphics** — internal tracking + external-facing versions
- **Website** — WordPress/Enfold on WP Engine; donation integration with recurring giving; campaign microsite; mobile-optimized, SEO-configured
- **8 Staff Training Videos** — your team updates the site independently after launch

Suede has designed capital campaign materials for a retreat center before (MetaCampus). He consolidates web developer + UX/UI designer + graphic designer into one execution stream. No handoffs. No translation loss. What you approve in Figma is what goes live.

## 4. Cannibalizing Sister Organizations

**The problem:** Growing Tergar Retreats can't come at the expense of International or Institute.

**Our approach:**

- **Distinct audience lanes:** All five new segments above are audiences the sister orgs aren't pursuing
- **Complementary positioning:** International = education. Institute = scholarship. Retreats = practice and place. We refer, not replicate
- **Shared funnel, distinct conversion:** Capital campaign list becomes future retreat marketing list. Everyone benefits
- **Brand guidelines as guardrails:** The messaging framework will define where Retreats' territory ends and the mandala's begins

Mikyo has watched this go wrong in his own Buddhist community. He understands mandala dynamics from the inside.

---

## 5. Focus Discipline

**The problem:** Seven projects in one RFP. Four directions at once. Risk of scattering.

**Our approach:** We enforce Matt's prioritization:

1. **Brand foundation first** (Weeks 1-4) — nothing else moves until this is locked
2. **Website + campaign collateral** (Weeks 5-9) — Suede on design/dev, Mikyo on content, working from the brand blueprint
3. **Testing, training, launch** (Weeks 10-12) — grant-ready by March 31
4. **Marketing, PR, social** (Phase 2, April onward) — only after the foundation is solid

Ian holds the line. Five years managing distributed teams at RaidGuild. His job is scope discipline.

## 6. Timeline Realism vs. Urgency

**The problem:** Original 9-week timeline was aggressive. You need 5 review rounds. Organizational sign-off takes time.

**Revised 12-week timeline:**

| Week | Focus | Review Round |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Discovery & Alignment | Review #1 (5-7 days) |
| 3-4 | Foundation Strategy | Review #2 (5-7 days) |
| 5-6 | Priority Content | Review #3 (5-7 days) |
| 7 | Design Begins | Review #4 (5-7 days) |
| 8-9 | Content Priority 2 & Design Refinement | Review #5 (5-7 days) |
| 10-11 | Development & Production | Internal QA only |
| 12 | Testing, Training & Launch | Final walkthrough Mar 28-29 |

**Cost remains $25,000.** Adjusted milestones: Contract signing (20% / $5k) → Strategy approval Week 4 (28% / $7k) → Content & Design approval Week 9 (32% / $8k) → Launch Week 12 (20% / $5k).

**Critical success factors:** Single Tergar point person to consolidate feedback. Pre-scheduled review windows. 5-7 day max per round. Weekly 30-minute syncs.

If latency is on your side, we absorb it without cost escalation. We get paid at milestones, not on the clock.

## 7. Conversion Strategy

**The problem:** Donors first, then convert to retreat participants? Or build a retreat audience and ask for money?

**Matt's instinct is correct. Here's the framework:**

```
Awareness → Cultivation → Gift → Stewardship → Retreat Conversion
```

2026 primary engine: capital campaign. Every website visit, every media placement drives toward getting potential donors into Christy's pipeline. Quiet phase CTA: "learn about the vision" — not "book a retreat."

Post-gift, the conversion flips: "You helped build it. Now come experience it."

**Parallel track:** SEO-optimized content about intensive practice and contemplative neuroscience builds organic retreat interest while doubling as credibility signals for researching donors. One funnel, two exit points.

---

## 8. Geographic Assumptions

**The problem:** You don't know if the US base will fly to Portugal. Western Europe is likely but unproven.

**Our approach: test, don't bet.**

- **Geo-tracked analytics** — real data on geographic interest within 90 days of launch
- **Segmented messaging** — European ("a train ride away"), US ("worth the journey"), Global ("a destination for the world's most dedicated practitioners")
- **Phase 2 test campaigns** in specific European markets before committing major resources
- **Science angle as geographic bridge** — neuroscience doesn't care about geography; it draws an international audience

---

## 9. Three Ships at Once

**The problem:** US nonprofit, Portuguese for-profit subsidiary, capital campaign. Three communications channels that must align but stay separate.

**One website, three clear pathways:**

- **Tergar Retreats US:** The parent brand. Mission, team, credibility
- **Samadhi Retreat Center:** The place. Architecture, sustainability, programs. A section within the main site (benefits from parent SEO)
- **Capital Campaign Microsite:** The ask. Naming opportunities, progress tracker, donation page. Visually distinct, integrated navigation

**One voice, three registers:**
- Retreats US: "We are building something unprecedented"
- Samadhi: "Stone walls. Mountain air. Ancient practice"
- Campaign: "Your gift builds the future of practice"

Same family. Different rooms.

## 10. Bandwidth Constraints

**The problem:** Matthew Zimwalt's time is at a premium. Christy's plate is full. You need a team that runs autonomously.

**What we need from you:**
- Christy or Zak: weekly 30-minute check-in (cancel if not needed)
- Matthew Zimwalt: 2 discovery interviews (60 min) + 2 leadership reviews
- 5-7 day turnaround on reviews

**What we handle independently:** Everything else — strategy, content, design, development, project management, training materials, technical implementation. The person who hears your feedback is the person who executes the change.

## The Unanswered Questions

### Capital Campaign Experience

Matt asked directly. Here's the full answer.

**Direct analogs:**
- Suede designed the MetaCampus retreat center pitch deck — capital campaign materials for a contemplative space with fundraising narrative, financial projections, and naming opportunities
- Suede managed operations at a retreat center in Guatemala (2014-2015) — lived operational experience, not theoretical
- Mikyo observed a successful under-2M-euro Buddhist temple construction campaign (Zomlinggar) from the inside — quiet phase cultivation through public fundraising
- Suede wrote and won a $75K grant proposal (Harmony Protocol/CryptoLumenati)

**Transferable at scale:**
- Mikyo built EigenLayer from zero to 150K+ community members — the mechanics (identify top supporters, cultivate with insider access, convert enthusiasm to commitment) are identical to capital campaign cultivation
- Mikyo grew Ritual from 0 to 40K X followers and 35K to 100K+ Discord — building awareness and converting attention from a cold start, which is exactly your 1,000-CRM-contact situation

**The honest framing:** No one has run a $3.5M capital campaign for a Buddhist retreat center before. This project is unprecedented. But we've designed campaign materials for retreat centers, managed retreat operations, observed Buddhist construction campaigns from the inside, won grant funding, and built communities at massive scale from zero. That combination — plus our domain expertise in Buddhist organizational dynamics — is more relevant than a conventional agency's portfolio of hospital or university campaigns.

### Web3/Crypto Relevance

**The translation:**

| Web3 Skill | Tergar Application |
|---|---|
| Communities around intangible value | Community around meditation, wisdom, lineage |
| Converting strangers to evangelists at scale | Converting newcomers to practitioners and donors |
| Belonging in decentralized networks | Sangha cohesion across a global community |
| Tiered access and token-gated experiences | Donor recognition tiers and naming opportunities |
| Treasury governance for DAOs | Nonprofit governance and fund stewardship |
| Shipping under extreme uncertainty | Operating a startup nonprofit with a distributed mandala |
| Storytelling for abstract value | Communicating intensive practice to secular audiences |

**The reframe:** Web3 is the most competitive attention environment on the internet. Every project starts with nothing — no brand, no audience, no trust. That is exactly Tergar Retreats' situation. The craft is the same. The stakes are higher. The motivation runs deeper.

**What we are NOT doing:** No blockchain, no tokens, no crypto jargon in any materials.

**What we ARE bringing:** A battle-tested playbook for building communities from zero at massive scale, plus direct access to high-net-worth tech individuals interested in meditation and consciousness — an entirely new donor segment.

## Why a Small Team Is Better for This Project

**The people in this meeting do the work.** No bait-and-switch. No junior handoff. Mikyo writes every word. Suede designs every page and writes every line of code. Ian manages every milestone. The person who hears your vision executes it.

**You are our primary client.** Not one of thirty accounts. Tergar Retreats is the main event for 2026.

**Less expensive, more senior.** Three roles consolidated into one at $85/hr instead of three separate billable people at a larger agency. $79K for a full year of strategy, design, development, content, PR, and project management — six functional roles, three senior people, zero overhead bloat.

**No learning curve on your world.** A conventional agency needs weeks to understand mandala dynamics, three-year retreat, and why you can't just "ask the guru to do a TikTok." We walked in and spoke your language.

**We build your capacity, not your dependency.** Training videos, editable source files, documented systems. Self-sufficient when we're done.

**24-48 hour response times.** Ian is managing your project, not six others. Weekly syncs with the option to cancel. Milestone-based payment — you never pay ahead of delivered work.

**RaidGuild as a deep bench.** Small team backed by a collective that's shipped $367M+ in infrastructure. Surge capacity if we ever need it.

## Why Us Over the Other Agency

**They bring nonprofit experience. We bring *this* nonprofit's experience.** The distance between "nonprofit marketing" and "understanding why a mandala creates donor fatigue" is the distance between reading about meditation and sitting on a cushion.

**More expensive for less coverage.** Matt said it in the meeting. We deliver more for less because we've eliminated the bureaucracy.

**No brand strategy depth for this context.** Zak said it: they don't have someone with 25 years of living in community. The nuances — talking about lineage without sounding cultish, presenting a teacher without creating a personality cult, asking for money in a tradition that values renunciation, differentiating within a mandala without creating competition — require someone who has navigated these tensions. Mikyo has.

**No retreat center operations experience.** Suede didn't read about retreat centers. He ran one.

**At a larger agency, you are a line item. With us, you are the mission.**

## What Happens Next

We are ready to start immediately.

**Week 1:** Contract execution, kickoff call, discovery interview scheduling, existing asset audit, WordPress staging setup on WP Engine.

**Week 2:** Discovery interviews begin (isolated, one-on-one), sitemap and IA draft, competitive positioning refinement, initial wireframe exploration.

No onboarding period. No ramp-up. We've already studied your organization, competitive landscape, audience personas, and existing digital presence.
