# Tergar's Top Concerns, Issues & Needs

## 1. Donor Fatigue & Need to Cultivate Net New Audiences
The mandala has multiple orgs hitting the same people repeatedly. Matt said it directly: "there's a little bit of donor fatigue because there is a mandala. And people get hit up multiple times for multiple kinds of projects." They have only 1,000 contacts in their CRM and need to build entirely new donor, practitioner, and retreat participant segments from scratch.

## 2. Brand Identity Crisis — Who Is Tergar Retreats?
The Tergar name is known, but Tergar *Retreats* specifically is not. They need to differentiate as the "practice brand" within the mandala without being "wildly eccentric" or alienating the existing audience. Matt: "We need to be slightly different from the rest of the Mandala without being like our own weird, wildly eccentric thing." They have no cohesive brand narrative, messaging framework, or voice guidelines.

## 3. Credibility & Legitimacy for Major Gift Fundraising
Their web presence and collateral must look "polished AF" so that when donors research them, they trust the org has its act together. Matt: "when funders or potential donors go to look at us, they're like, totally trust these guys have their shit together." Without this, Christy can't confidently pitch major gifts for the $3.5M capital campaign.

## 4. Cannibalizing Sister Organizations
Closely related to donor fatigue — they're terrified of stepping on the toes of Tergar International and Tergar Institute. Matt called this "one of the core strategic challenges": growing their own audience without poaching from or competing with the other mandala orgs. They need a partner who understands this nuance.

## 5. Focus Discipline — Too Many Directions at Once
Matt was explicit about this: "we're already in like four different directions. We can't move any of those directions forward without foundational work done on branding." They have 7 projects bundled into one RFP and risk scattering energy. They need a partner who can keep them focused on the critical path: brand foundation, then campaign collateral, then everything else.

## 6. Timeline Realism vs. Urgency
The timeline is aggressive — construction breaks ground in months, the $3.5M campaign is in its quiet phase, and they need infrastructure before the public launch. But Zak flagged that the team's timelines "are aggressive" and that larger org reviews slow things down. They need 5 rounds of review with leadership sign-off, which adds latency. The tension: they need it fast, but organizational reality is slow.

## 7. Conversion Strategy Uncertainty
Matt raised an open strategic question: should they attract donors first and later convert them to retreat participants, or build a retreat audience and then ask for donations? He bet on "donors first" but acknowledged it's unresolved. They need a partner who can think through this funnel strategically.

## 8. Unproven Assumptions About Their Audience
Matt was candid: "We've made a number of assumptions about how excited people will be to come fly to Portugal, five hour time difference, hop a bus for two and a half hours or whatever, to get to the middle of nowhere." They don't actually know if their existing US base will travel. They need to test Western Europe as their core geo, and they need messaging that works across those unknowns.

## 9. Organizational Complexity — Three Ships at Once
Matt framed it as "trying to build three ships at once": (1) Tergar Retreats US nonprofit, (2) Portuguese for-profit subsidiary running the center, and (3) the capital campaign itself. Three distinct communications channels that need to be aligned but separate. This is operationally challenging and requires a partner who won't add confusion.

## 10. Resource & Bandwidth Constraints
Matthew Zimwalt (ED) is the knowledge base and voice but his time is "at a premium." Christy already has "a plate that's full and a second plate waiting to be dumped on top." They need a partner that can operate with high autonomy, not one that needs constant hand-holding.
