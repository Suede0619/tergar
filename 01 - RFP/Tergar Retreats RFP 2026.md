# *Tergar Retreats: Development + Marketing Agency RFP (2026)*

# **1. Organization Overview**

---

[Tergar Retreats](https://tergar-retreats.org/) is the in-person retreat arm of the global [Tergar Meditation Community](https://www.tergarsangha.org/), guided by Tibetan meditation master Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. Our work centers on creating retreat environments where people from all backgrounds can explore awareness, compassion, and wisdom in a grounded, directly-experiential way.

We are in the process of building a new retreat center in Podentes, Portugal. This center is being referred to as the Samadhi Retreat Center which will offer:

- Short-term residential retreats (anything from a weekend to a year long retreat)
- A traditional 3-Year Retreat Program for advanced practitioners (3 years, 3 months, 3 days)
- Teacher training & mentorship for the next generation of lineage guides
- A multi-year Capital Campaign to support land acquisition, facilities, scholarships, and long-term sustainability

Phase One (currently underway) centers on the 3-Year Retreat Campus, including:

- 40 private retreat bungalows
- Meditation hall
- Dining hall
- Renovation of the old hotel (aka Casa Principal) for guides & staff
- Landscaped grounds designed to support practice and retreat

Future phases will complete infrastructure for short-term retreats, a temple/events hall, and expanded scholarship and endowment funds to ensure equitable access and long-term sustainability.

Tergar Retreats is committed to environmental stewardship and rural revitalization. The site is being developed with sustainable materials, ecological sensitivity, and close partnership with local community leaders.

As we enter 2026, we are preparing to bring our retreat offerings and capital campaign more fully into the public sphere through a modern digital presence, refined messaging, and a strategic marketing and visibility plan.

We are seeking a development & marketing agency partner that can effectively function as an extension of our internal team—serving as a fractional marketing department for the year ahead.

By “fractional marketing department,” we mean a partner who can provide ongoing strategy, content creation, design, PR support, and execution without requiring us to hire internal staff.

# **2. Our Ask**

### **Overview**

We are seeking a partner to execute on the next strategic phase of Tergar Retreats and the Samadhi Retreat Center by providing integrated storytelling, design, web development, marketing, and communications support.

We have **a major deadline for grants in March**, and will want to be building assets for our overall fundraising campaign. We’re currently in the ‘quiet phase’ of our fundraising, which lasts until our public fundraising launch in late 2026.
