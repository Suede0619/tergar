# Tergar Audiences: Who We're Building For
## Quick-Reference Persona Guide

---

## The Big Picture

Tergar's marketing serves four distinct audiences across two campaign phases. Each audience arrives with different needs, different skepticism, and different decision criteria. Every deliverable we produce -- website, donor deck, social post, press release -- must be designed with a specific audience in mind.

| Phase | Audience | What They Want | When |
|-------|----------|---------------|------|
| Quiet Phase | Major Donors | Legacy and vision | Jan - Oct 2026 |
| Quiet Phase | Grant Officers | Evidence and feasibility | Jan - Mar 2026 |
| Public Launch | Future Retreatants | Authenticity and invitation | Nov 2026+ |
| Ongoing | Serious Practitioners | Tradition and rigor | Post-construction |

## 1. The Major Donor

**Who they are:** Affluent individuals (net worth $5M-$50M+), ages 45-65, often in tech, entrepreneurship, or inherited wealth. Based in metros like SF, NYC, LA, Boulder, Seattle. Most have a personal meditation practice. Many have sat retreats at Tergar, IMS, Spirit Rock, or similar centers.

**What drives them:** They're past the accumulation phase. They want meaning, legacy, and impact. They want to fund something real -- not another wellness brand, but something that will endure and serve future generations. They are deeply allergic to inauthenticity.

**What they need from us:**
- A Case for Support that feels premium, honest, and grounded -- not flashy
- A donor pitch deck that makes the vision tangible and the ask clear
- A website that passes the credibility check (they will look)
- Naming and sponsorship opportunities that feel meaningful, not transactional
- Materials their financial advisors or spouses can review and respect

**What makes them say yes:** Vision + competence + authenticity. They need to see that the project is real, the team can execute, and the lineage is honored. A personal connection to Rinpoche or senior leadership is often the final catalyst.

**What makes them say no:** Slick marketing that feels corporate. Vague impact claims. Disorganized or amateur materials. Any whiff of mission drift toward "wellness brand."

**Our deliverables for this audience:**
- Case for Support document
- Donor pitch deck
- Naming & sponsorship package
- Gift pyramid (internal + external versions)
- Donor cultivation one-pager
- Website (as credibility foundation)

## 2. The Grant Officer

**Who they are:** Program officers at foundations aligned with Buddhism, contemplative science, or cultural preservation. Ages 35-55. Graduate-educated. Professionally rigorous. They evaluate dozens of proposals per cycle and must justify every recommendation to their board.

**What drives them:** Mission alignment and organizational competence. They may be personally drawn to contemplative practice, but their job is to assess feasibility, impact, and sustainability. They are looking for reasons to say yes AND reasons to say no.

**What they need from us:**
- Clear, concise grant-supporting materials with specific goals and metrics
- A website that demonstrates organizational maturity
- Evidence of realistic planning -- timeline, budget, contingencies
- Articulation of who benefits and how impact will be measured
- Proof of diverse funding sources and long-term sustainability

**What makes them say yes:** A well-organized, evidence-based case. Professional materials. Clear metrics. A sense that this organization has the capacity to execute.

**What makes them say no:** Overly ambitious scope without realistic planning. Materials that are disorganized or hard to parse. Lack of measurable outcomes. A project that feels like it depends entirely on one charismatic leader.

**Critical deadline:** March 2026 -- grant applications must be submitted with our materials.

**Our deliverables for this audience:**
- Case for Support (grant-ready version)
- Website (due diligence checkpoint)
- Campaign narrative and supporting data
- All collateral formatted for grant submission packages

## 3. The Future Retreatant

**Who they are:** Millennials (28-42) and Gen Z (22-30). Income $60K-$150K. Urban/suburban, globally distributed. Working in tech, creative fields, healthcare, education. Spiritually curious but not traditionally religious. They've tried Headspace, maybe done a yoga retreat, possibly read a Thich Nhat Hanh book. They want more.

**What drives them:** A growing sense that modern life is missing something. They're overwhelmed by the attention economy and hungry for depth, but skeptical of institutions and anything that feels like organized religion. They value authenticity above all else. They want community, not just a solo practice. They care about social justice and sustainability.

**What they need from us:**
- A website that feels modern, beautiful, and welcoming -- not insider-y or intimidating
- Clear language about what to expect with no jargon (no unexplained Sanskrit, no assumption of Buddhist knowledge)
- Visual storytelling: the land, the architecture, the practice, the people
- Practical information: pricing, scholarships, what's included, how to prepare
- Social content that embodies the teachings rather than just describing them
- An entry point that doesn't require a three-year commitment

**What makes them say yes:** Beauty + authenticity + accessibility. A feeling of "this is what I've been looking for" without the pressure of "you must become a Buddhist." Tergar's dual-path structure (secular Joy of Living + traditional Path of Liberation) is perfectly designed for this audience.

**What makes them say no:** Insider language that makes them feel excluded. A website that looks dated or institutional. Messaging that feels preachy or cultish. No clear pricing or practical information. Any sense that this is "only for real Buddhists."

**Timeline:** Public launch late 2026. This audience is Phase 2.

**Our deliverables for this audience:**
- Website (primary discovery and booking tool)
- Social media content and visual storytelling
- Email nurture sequences
- Press placements and podcast features
- Blog and long-form content

## 4. The Serious Practitioner

**Who they are:** Ages 30-60, wide range. Years or decades of dedicated meditation practice. May have completed long retreats (1 month, 3 months). Likely already connected to Tergar or Rinpoche's teachings. Financially stable enough to consider stepping away from ordinary life for 3+ years.

**What drives them:** A deep, unwavering commitment to the path. They want the real thing -- traditional three-year retreat under authentic masters in an unbroken lineage. They've been waiting for this opportunity in the West. For them, this isn't a "retreat experience." It's the culmination of years of preparation.

**What they need from us:**
- Detailed information about the retreat structure, teachers, and facilities
- Realistic construction and launch timeline
- Evidence of authentic lineage and qualified retreat masters
- Scholarship and financial support information
- A sense that this will actually happen

**What makes them say yes:** Authenticity, specificity, and trust. They already believe in the path. They need to believe in the project.

**What makes them say no:** Vagueness about the retreat program. Unrealistic timelines. Any sense that the project is more about the center than the practice.

**Timeline:** Post-construction. This audience is downstream but should be kept warm throughout.

**Our deliverables for this audience:**
- Website (detailed retreat information section)
- Direct community communications via existing Tergar channels
- Retreat-specific collateral (when the time comes)

## 5. The Internal Stakeholder: Christy Gillham

**Who she is:** Development Manager at Tergar Retreats. The person evaluating proposals, managing the agency relationship, and justifying the selection to leadership and the board. She is both our client contact and our first audience.

**What she needs:** Confidence that we understand the mission. Clarity on scope, timeline, and pricing. A sense that we'll be an extension of her team, not another thing to manage. Strong ROI on a limited budget. Values alignment.

**Her evaluation criteria (from the RFP):**
1. Alignment with mission and values
2. Strength of strategic thinking
3. Quality of past work
4. Clarity of process
5. Cost/value alignment
6. Ability to serve as a long-term partner

**What this means for today's meeting:** Christy is evaluating whether she can trust us and whether she can defend choosing us to her leadership. Everything we say should make both of those easier.

## Design Implications for Suede

Every design choice communicates to a specific audience. Here's the quick filter:

| Design Decision | Donor / Grant Officer | Future Retreatant | Serious Practitioner |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Visual tone | Premium, restrained, trustworthy | Modern, warm, inviting | Traditional, grounded, serious |
| Typography | Clean, professional serif/sans | Contemporary, approachable | Could lean more traditional |
| Color palette | Muted, earthy, confident | Can be warmer, more alive | Grounded, not flashy |
| Photography | The land, the architecture, Rinpoche | People practicing, community, Portugal | Retreat settings, practice spaces |
| Information density | High -- they want details | Low to medium -- don't overwhelm | High -- they want specifics |
| Call to action | "Learn about giving opportunities" | "Explore retreats" / "Start here" | "View the 3-year retreat program" |

The website must serve all four audiences from a single front door. That's an information architecture challenge, not a visual design challenge. Clear navigation paths, audience-aware landing pages, and a visual hierarchy that guides without overwhelming.

## The One-Line Version

- **Donors:** "Will this endure?"
- **Grant Officers:** "Can they execute?"
- **Retreatants:** "Is this for me?"
- **Practitioners:** "Is this the real thing?"
- **Christy:** "Can I trust them?"

Every deliverable answers one of these questions.
