# Sasquatch's Meeting Prep
## Personal Preparation for the Tergar Interview

## Your Role in This Meeting

You are the **project manager and operational anchor**. You're the reason this team delivers on time, on budget, and without putting strain on the client. In a meeting where two creatives (Mikyo and Suede) will be talking about narrative, design, and their personal connection to the dharma, your job is different: you're the person who makes the Tergar team feel **safe** that this will actually get done.

Every nonprofit has been burned by a creative team that had great ideas and missed every deadline. You are the antidote to that fear.

   - Mikyo's: https://hackmd.io/@SasquatchTru/H1oe8Ud7Wl
   - Suede's: https://hackmd.io/@SasquatchTru/rkT6LUuXWx
   - You wrote these. Know the week-by-week cadence and client touchpoints by heart.
3. **The Phase 1 timeline** -- the critical milestones:
   - Week 1: Kickoff workshop
   - Week 3: Strategy review
   - Week 4: Wireframe review
   - Week 5: Design concepts + content drafts

## Questions You Might Get Asked -- And How to Answer

### About Project Management and Process

**Q: "Walk us through how this project would actually work week by week."**

A: "Phase 1 is nine weeks. Week 1 is a kickoff workshop where we immerse ourselves in your world -- stakeholder interviews, content audit, brand review. Weeks 2-4 are strategy and wireframes: we're building the foundation before any visual design or final content. You see wireframes at Week 4 and give feedback before we move forward. Weeks 5-8 are production: design, content, development happening in parallel. You have review touchpoints at Weeks 5, 6, 7, and 8 -- you're never in the dark. Week 9 is testing, QA, and launch. Every milestone has a clear deliverable and your approval before we proceed."

**Q: "How do you keep the project on track?"**

A: "Clear milestones, regular check-ins, and direct communication. I maintain a project timeline that everyone can see. If something shifts -- a deliverable takes longer, feedback is delayed, priorities change -- I flag it immediately and we adjust together. I've been managing distributed teams since 2021, including at RaidGuild where I handle client onboarding, team assembly, and relationship management across multiple concurrent projects. Keeping creative teams on schedule is literally what I do."

**Q: "What tools do you use for project management?"**

A: "I'm fluent in Notion, which is flexible enough to match however your team works. I'd set up a shared project board with task tracking, a content calendar, and a file repository so nothing gets lost. I also use Discord or Slack for fast daily communication and scheduled video calls for milestone reviews. I'll adapt to whatever tools your team already uses -- the point is transparency, not a specific platform."

**Q: "What does communication look like during the project?"**

A: "You'll have a standing check-in rhythm -- I'd suggest weekly during Phase 1 given the tight timeline, shifting to bi-weekly during the lighter months of Phase 2 and back to weekly during the intense launch period. Between check-ins, I'm available within 24-48 hours on any channel. You'll never have to wonder what's happening. If you email on Tuesday, you hear back by Thursday at the latest. More likely same day."

**Q: "What happens if we fall behind on feedback or approvals?"**

A: "I build buffer into the timeline, but I'm also direct about it. If feedback is due and I haven't received it, I'll follow up promptly and let you know how a delay impacts downstream work. The proposal includes a five-business-day feedback window for standard requests. If we're approaching a hard deadline like the March 31 grant submission, I'll escalate early so we're never in a last-minute crunch. My job is to protect the timeline for both sides."

**Q: "How do you handle scope creep?"**

A: "By defining scope clearly upfront -- which we've done in our scope docs -- and by having honest conversations when new requests come in. If something is out of scope, I'll flag it, provide a quick estimate, and let you decide whether to add it. We're not rigid -- the Phase 2 retainer is designed to flex with your needs. But I won't let undefined work pile up and blow the timeline or budget without everyone being aware."

### About the Team and Your Role

**Q: "You're the project manager. What do you actually do day-to-day?"**

A: "I'm the connective tissue. I coordinate between Mikyo and Suede so their work stays in sync. I manage the timeline, run the check-ins, handle client communications, maintain project documentation, and make sure nothing falls through the cracks. I'm also your single point of contact -- if you need something, you come to me and I route it to the right person. That simplifies your life."

**Q: "How do the three of you work together?"**

A: "Mikyo leads strategy and content. Suede leads design and development. I keep both streams coordinated and on schedule. We've worked together through RaidGuild, so the dynamic is already established. There's no ramp-up period for us to figure out how to collaborate. I know how Mikyo and Suede work, what they need, and how to keep them unblocked."

**Q: "You're a small team. What if someone gets sick or has an emergency?"**

A: "Two things. First, because we're a small team, there's no single point of failure on knowledge -- we all understand the full project, not just our slice. Second, we have RaidGuild as a deep bench. RaidGuild is a decentralized collective of designers, developers, and strategists. If we need additional capacity for any reason -- planned or unplanned -- I can bring in vetted talent quickly. That's a safety net that most small teams can't offer."

**Q: "What's your experience with RaidGuild?"**

A: "I've been with RaidGuild since January 2021 as an Account and Project Manager. I handle client onboarding, assemble project teams, and manage relationships across the full lifecycle of engagements. RaidGuild has shipped over $367 million in infrastructure and built foundational DAO tooling. It's a cooperative -- members self-organize around shared values. That experience managing distributed, self-organizing teams is directly relevant to how I'll manage this project: clear accountability, transparent process, and respect for everyone's autonomy."

---

### About Your Personal Connection

**Q: "Tell us about your connection to contemplative practice."**

A: "My practice is personal -- yoga, mindful meditation, and wilderness immersion. I live in the Tetons and spend a lot of time in the mountains, which is where I connect most deeply with stillness and presence. I also own and operate a community hub in Victor, Idaho -- a physical gathering space that serves the local community. That experience of building and managing a real-world space where people come together is directly relevant. I understand what it takes to create a container for community, both logistically and in terms of the care it requires."

**Q: "You run a community space. How does that relate to this project?"**

A: "A retreat center is a community space at its core. I know the operational reality -- managing the physical environment, serving the people who show up, handling the unglamorous logistics that make the experience possible. That gives me empathy for what the Tergar team deals with daily. When I'm managing this project, I'm not just thinking about deliverables -- I'm thinking about how the website, the donor materials, and the marketing actually serve the people running the center and the people who will walk through its doors."

### About Budget and Logistics

**Q: "Walk us through the payment structure."**

A: "Phase 1 is milestone-based. $5,000 at contract signing to engage services. $8,000 when Weeks 1-4 are complete -- that's discovery, strategy, and wireframes delivered and approved. $9,000 at Weeks 5-8 -- development, content, and design delivered. $3,000 at Week 9 -- testing, launch, and final handoff. You're never paying ahead of completed work. Phase 2 is a $6,000 monthly retainer invoiced on the first of each month, with hours rolling over month-to-month. Either party can terminate with 30 days' notice."

**Q: "Is there flexibility on pricing?"**

A: "We've priced this to deliver real value without cutting corners. $79,000 for a full year of strategy, design, development, content, PR, and ongoing support is strong value -- especially considering you're getting three specialized roles plus project management. That said, if budget is a concern, we're open to discussing scope adjustments. We could narrow Phase 1 deliverables or adjust the Phase 2 retainer. What we won't do is discount the work and then deliver less quality. We'd rather have an honest conversation about scope."

**Q: "What about the optional enhancements -- CRM integration, Retreat Guru, video production?"**

A: "Those are available but intentionally separate from the core proposal. We didn't want to overload the budget with things you might not need right now. If any of those become priorities -- say Retreat Guru integration for booking, or video production for the public launch -- we can add them to the retainer or quote them as standalone projects. We're flexible, and we'd rather scope them properly than include them as line items we haven't fully planned."

**Q: "How does the retainer work in practice?"**

A: "You get $6,000 worth of work per month across design, content, marketing, and PR. The workload is intentionally variable -- lighter during the quiet campaign phase (April-August), moderate during pre-launch (September-October), and intensive during public launch (November-December). Hours roll over, so a quiet month isn't wasted budget. I track hours and deliverables so there's full transparency on what you're getting."

### Potentially Tricky Questions

**Q: "Your team's background is in web3 and crypto. Isn't that a completely different world?"**

A: "The industry context is different. The skills are identical. Project management, client communication, timeline management, coordinating creative teams, shipping on deadline -- those are universal. And web3 actually sharpened those skills because the pace is intense and the stakes are high. What I'd highlight is that our team brings those battle-tested operational skills AND personal alignment with Tergar's mission. Most agencies can offer one or the other. We offer both."

**Q: "We're a small nonprofit. We don't have a lot of bandwidth. How much of our time will this take?"**

A: "Minimizing your time investment is a core design principle of our approach. We've built specific client touchpoints into the timeline -- about one review meeting per week during Phase 1, less during Phase 2. Between those, your main job is providing feedback within five business days. I handle everything else: coordination, scheduling, documentation, follow-ups. We also deliver training and templates so your team builds capacity over time rather than becoming dependent on us. The goal is that by the end of 2026, you have systems and skills you can run independently."

**Q: "What if we don't like the direction the work is going?"**

A: "That's what the milestone structure is for. You see and approve wireframes before design starts. You see and approve design before development starts. You review content drafts before they're finalized. At every stage, there's a gate where you give feedback and we adjust. If the direction isn't right, we catch it early and course-correct before time and money are spent going further. Two revision rounds are built into every web asset."

**Q: "Have you managed a project for a nonprofit or dharma organization before?"**

A: "My direct nonprofit project management experience is through RaidGuild engagements and my own community hub, which operates as a community-serving space. Mikyo and Suede bring the deep nonprofit and dharma-specific experience. My role is to make sure their expertise gets delivered on time and on budget. That's a universal skill. And my personal practice and community-building experience mean I understand the values and the culture -- I'm not coming in cold."

## Your Strongest Cards -- Play Them

1. **You are the operational guarantee.** In a meeting with two passionate creatives, you're the person who says "and here's exactly how and when it gets done." That's what the client needs to hear.

2. **RaidGuild as a deep bench.** You have an entire collective of designers, developers, and strategists behind you. The Tergar team isn't hiring three freelancers -- they're hiring a team backed by an organization that's shipped $367M+ in infrastructure.

3. **Distributed team management since 2021.** You've been managing remote, self-organizing teams for five years. This isn't a new way of working for you.

4. **You run a physical community space.** You know what it's like to build and operate a place where people gather. That's empathy the Tergar team will feel.

5. **Milestone-based payment de-risks the engagement.** You can articulate this clearly: they never pay ahead of delivered work, and there are approval gates at every stage. That's trust built into the structure.

6. **You're the single point of contact.** One person to call, one person who knows where everything stands. That simplifies their life.

## Things to Avoid

- Don't try to lead on strategy or creative topics -- that's Mikyo's and Suede's territory. Jump in on process, timeline, logistics, and team coordination.
- Don't over-explain the web3/DAO/RaidGuild structure. If they ask, keep it simple: "RaidGuild is a cooperative of designers, developers, and strategists. I've managed projects there since 2021. It gives us a deep bench of vetted talent if we ever need additional capacity."
- Don't get defensive if they question the team's size. Reframe it: small team = the people in the room do the work. No handoff, no junior staff, no bait-and-switch.
- Don't make the meeting feel like a project status update. Be warm, be personal. Share why you care about this work. Your community hub, your practice, your life in the Tetons -- these are real, and they matter to a client like Tergar.
- Don't let the conversation run long without checking the clock. If you're the PM, manage the meeting time too. A polite "I want to make sure we have time to hear what else you need from us" at the 45-minute mark shows you're already doing the job.

## Your Job in the Room

Think of the meeting in three layers:

- **Mikyo** makes them feel inspired (narrative, vision, lineage connection)
- **Suede** makes them feel confident (tangible work, design expertise, production chops)
- **You** make them feel safe (process, timelines, communication, accountability)

All three are necessary. None alone is sufficient. Your layer is the one that closes deals, because no organization signs a contract with a team they don't trust to deliver.

---

## Meeting Management Notes

Since you're the PM, you're also informally running the meeting flow:

- **Opening:** Let Mikyo set the tone with the personal connection, then briefly introduce yourself and the team structure
- **Middle:** Facilitate the conversation -- if it's drifting into deep design or strategy details, gently redirect: "We'd love to get into the details after kickoff. Right now, can we hear more about what's most important to you?"
- **Closing:** You own the close. Ask about their decision timeline, what else they need from you, and offer the concrete next step: "We're ready to start immediately. If selected, I'll have a kickoff workshop on the calendar within a week."
- **Time check:** At 45 minutes, make sure you pivot to questions and next steps if you haven't already.
