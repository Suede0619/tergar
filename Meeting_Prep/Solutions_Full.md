# Follow-Up Summary: How We Solve Tergar's Problems

*For use in drafting a post-meeting follow-up email. January 27, 2026.*

---

## Opening

Thank you for the conversation today. We walked away with a much clearer picture of where Tergar Retreats is, what you need, and what keeps you up at night. Rather than send a generic "great meeting" email, we wanted to respond directly to the concerns and questions raised in the meeting — with specific solutions.

Below, we address each concern we heard, the unanswered questions Matt raised, and the concrete ways our team is built to solve these problems. No other agency you're considering can match this combination of domain expertise, strategic depth, and production capability at this price point.

---

## Concern 1: Donor Fatigue & Cultivating Net New Audiences

**What we heard:** The mandala's existing base of 1,000 CRM contacts is tapped. Multiple Tergar organizations are hitting the same people for money. You need entirely new segments — not just new names on the same list.

**How we solve it:**

We will identify and pursue five net new audience segments that no other Tergar mandala organization is currently targeting. These are people who have never given to Tergar and may never have heard of it:

1. **Contemplative Science & Neuroscience Community.** Matt mentioned the Dan Brown and John paper on three-year retreat brain changes, and Rinpoche's involvement in that research. This is gold. There is an entire ecosystem of neuroscience researchers, Mind & Life alumni, contemplative studies academics, and science-curious donors who fund research into consciousness and well-being. We will build a media and outreach strategy around the science angle — positioning Samadhi as the only retreat center in the Western world where the kind of intensive practice studied in peer-reviewed neuroscience papers actually happens. This audience does not overlap with any existing Tergar org's donor base.

2. **Tech & Crypto Wealth.** Matt mentioned Matthew Zimwalt's Filecoin connections. Mikyo has spent years building communities in the crypto/web3 space and has direct relationships with high-net-worth individuals in that world — many of whom are personally interested in meditation and consciousness. The tech wealth demographic (founders, early employees, crypto investors) is among the most generous in philanthropic giving, and many are actively looking for meaningful places to direct capital. We will build a targeted cultivation track for this segment using Mikyo's existing network and Tergar's science credibility.

3. **Western European Wellness & Retreat Market.** The European wellness tourism market is projected to grow 20-30% in 2026. Portugal specifically is becoming a global destination for wellness, sustainability, and intentional living. There is a large, affluent European audience that currently attends secular wellness retreats (think 1440 Multiversity, but in Europe) who would be drawn to something deeper and more authentic. We will position Samadhi as the antidote to superficial wellness — "authentic practice without compromise" — and target this audience through European media, wellness publications, and partnerships with aligned organizations.

4. **Lapsed or Displaced Buddhist Practitioners.** Shambhala International's ongoing institutional crisis has left thousands of serious Western Buddhist practitioners without a spiritual home. Many of these are experienced meditators with deep practice, financial means, and a hunger for authentic community. Tergar's ethical clarity, stable leadership, and Rinpoche's charisma make it the natural landing place for these practitioners. We will craft messaging that speaks to this audience without exploiting the situation — positioning Tergar Retreats as a stable, trustworthy place for serious practice.

5. **Environmental & Rural Revitalization Philanthropists.** The Samadhi center's sustainable design, use of local materials, and integration with the rural Portuguese community is a story that appeals to a donor segment completely outside the Buddhist world: people who fund environmental stewardship, rural revitalization, and sustainable architecture. We will develop a parallel narrative track for foundations and individual donors in this space.

**Why this matters:** A conventional nonprofit agency would recycle the same donor list and run standard cultivation campaigns. We are proposing to open five entirely new fronts, each with a distinct value proposition that doesn't cannibalize any mandala organization.

## Concern 2: Brand Identity Crisis — Who Is Tergar Retreats?

**What we heard:** Christy said it plainly — "we're at the ground level." No brand narrative, no messaging framework, no voice guidelines. The Tergar name is known, but Tergar Retreats is not. You need to be recognizable as family without being confused for a sibling.

**How we solve it:**

Mikyo will lead a rigorous brand discovery process — not a questionnaire, not a group brainstorm, but isolated one-on-one stakeholder interviews (3-5 voices) designed to extract the authentic DNA of Tergar Retreats without groupthink contamination. This is how world-class brand strategists work, and it's how we built category-defining brands in the web3 space.

From discovery, we will deliver:

- **Brand Positioning Statement:** A single sentence that defines Tergar Retreats' unique role in the mandala and the world. Our working hypothesis: Tergar Retreats is *the practice brand* — where the rubber meets the road, where philosophy becomes embodied experience, where the deepest transformations in the Tergar path actually happen.

- **Master Narrative:** A 2-3 page narrative document that tells the Tergar Retreats story in a way that can be adapted for every audience — donors, practitioners, grant officers, media. This becomes the single source of truth for all communications.

- **Messaging Framework:** Audience-specific talking points for each segment (major donors, grant officers, seeking millennials, serious practitioners) with approved language, tone guidance, and key phrases.

- **Voice Guidelines:** How Tergar Retreats sounds — distinct from Tergar International (educational), distinct from Tergar Institute (scholarly), but unmistakably part of the family. Our instinct: warmer, more embodied, more grounded in place. Less "learn about meditation" and more "come practice."

- **Visual Identity Refinement:** Suede will evolve the existing mandala design system — not reinvent it — to give Tergar Retreats its own visual character. Think the same color family and typography, but with a distinct mood: more earth, more texture, more Portugal. We respect Matt's directive not to re-adjudicate the logo. This is refinement, not revolution.

**Why this matters:** Mikyo doesn't need to research Buddhist organizations to understand the landscape. He grew up in it. He knows the difference between how a dharma center talks to practitioners and how it talks to foundations. He knows what sounds authentic and what sounds like a nonprofit marketing agency trying to sound authentic. That fluency cannot be hired — it has to be lived.

## Concern 3: Credibility & Legitimacy for Major Gift Fundraising

**What we heard:** Matt was direct — donors need to see that "you've got your shit together." The website and collateral must be polished enough that Christy can walk into a room with a seven-figure ask and feel confident.

**How we solve it:**

Suede has designed capital campaign materials for a retreat center before — the MetaCampus pitch deck is a direct analog. He understands the specific requirements of donor-facing materials: corporate-grade design quality, clear financial narratives, compelling visual storytelling, and the subtle signals of organizational competence that major donors look for.

Phase 1 deliverables specifically designed for fundraising credibility:

- **Donor Pitch Deck:** Corporate-grade. Think VC pitch quality applied to a nonprofit campaign. Clean data visualization, professional typography, compelling narrative flow. Editable in Figma so your team can customize for specific meetings.

- **Case for Support (1-8 pages):** The foundational document Christy needs for every major gift conversation. Designed with the visual authority of a foundation annual report.

- **Naming & Sponsorship Package:** Elegant, dignified presentation of giving levels with clear recognition philosophy. No cheesy thermometer graphics. This document signals that you understand how major philanthropy works.

- **Gift Pyramid Graphics:** Both internal (detailed tracking for your team) and external (public-facing progress for donors). Clean, professional, campaign-aligned.

- **Website:** Built on WordPress with Enfold — a platform Matt already knows and trusts from running his own agency. WP Engine hosting. Drag-and-drop editing so anyone on your team can update it. Mobile-optimized, SEO-configured, analytics-tracked. Looking polished is table stakes. We'll also make it functional: donation integration with recurring giving, campaign progress tracking, and a microsite for the capital campaign that tells the Samadhi story with the visual weight it deserves.

- **8 Staff Training Videos:** Ten-minute tutorials so your team can update the site independently. No developer dependency after launch.

**Why this matters:** Suede consolidates three roles (web developer, UX/UI designer, graphic designer) into one senior-level execution stream. No handoffs between a designer and a developer. No coordination overhead. No quality loss in translation. One person who understands the vision, builds the design, and writes the code.

## Concern 4: Cannibalizing Sister Organizations

**What we heard:** Growing Tergar Retreats cannot come at the expense of Tergar International or Tergar Institute. Matt called this "one of the core strategic challenges."

**How we solve it:**

This is where having a practitioner on the team — someone who has lived inside a mandala-style organization — is not a nice-to-have but a necessity. Mikyo understands from direct experience how dharma organizations collide with each other. He's watched it go wrong in his own community.

Our approach:

- **Distinct Audience Lanes:** The five new segments above (science, tech, European wellness, displaced practitioners, environmental philanthropists) are audiences that Tergar International and Tergar Institute are not pursuing. We grow Tergar Retreats' audience without fishing in the same pond.

- **Complementary Positioning:** Tergar International owns education. Tergar Institute owns scholarship. Tergar Retreats owns practice and place. Every piece of messaging we create will reinforce this distinction rather than blur it. When someone on the Tergar Retreats site is curious about the Joy of Living curriculum, we send them to tergar.org. We don't replicate — we refer.

- **Shared Funnel, Distinct Conversion:** Matt's insight about building a donor list first and converting to retreat participants later is smart. We will design the digital infrastructure so that Tergar Retreats captures its own audience, but can share qualified leads with the broader mandala through CRM integration when appropriate. The capital campaign list becomes a future retreat marketing list. The retreat participant list becomes a future annual fund list. Everyone benefits.

- **Brand Guidelines as Guardrails:** The messaging framework we develop will include explicit guidance on where Tergar Retreats' territory ends and the mandala's begins. This becomes a reference document for all future communications, preventing accidental overreach.

---

## Concern 5: Focus Discipline — Too Many Directions

**What we heard:** Matt: "we're already in like four different directions." Seven projects in one RFP. The risk of scattering is real.

**How we solve it:**

We agree with Matt's prioritization and will enforce it:

**Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Brand discovery, master narrative, messaging framework. Nothing else moves forward until this is locked. This is the foundation everything else is built on.

**Sprint 2 (Weeks 2-8, overlapping):** Website build and campaign collateral — executed in parallel by Suede (design/dev) and Mikyo (content), with the brand foundation as their shared blueprint.

**Sprint 3 (Week 9):** Testing, training, launch. Everything grant-ready by March 31.

**Phase 2 (April onward):** Only then do we open the aperture to marketing, PR, social media, retreat promotion, and the broader visibility strategy. The retainer model means we don't disappear after Phase 1 — we shift gears.

Ian's role as project manager is specifically to hold the line on focus. He will manage the timeline, run the weekly check-ins, and make sure we're not chasing shiny objects. His five years managing distributed freelancer teams at RaidGuild means he knows how to keep scope disciplined without being rigid.

---

## Concern 6: Timeline Realism vs. Urgency

**What we heard:** Zak flagged that our timelines are aggressive compared to the other proposal. Matt requested we plan for 5 rounds of review. The tension: you need it fast, but organizational sign-off takes time.

**How we solve it:**

The original 9-week timeline didn't account for 5 rounds of internal Tergar reviews. We are proposing an extended 12-week timeline that maintains the March 31 grant deadline while building in proper review cycles and feedback integration periods.

**Key changes from our original proposal:**
- Extended from 9 to 12 weeks
- 5 formal review rounds (5-7 business days each) built into the schedule
- Sequential approach: strategy → content → design → development
- 2-week development buffer for testing and training
- Grant-ready materials delivered March 31

**Revised 12-week timeline:**

| Week | Focus | Deliverables | Review Round | Notes |
|------|-------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 1-2 | **Discovery & Alignment** | Discovery findings, strategic recommendations, platform recommendation | **Review #1** (5-7 days) | Kickoff, stakeholder interviews, audit |
| 3-4 | **Foundation Strategy** | Master narrative, messaging frameworks, info architecture, content pillars, marketing/PR strategy | **Review #2** (5-7 days) | Strategic foundation approval |
| 5-6 | **Priority Content** | Homepage copy, About sections, campaign hero content, Case for Support draft | **Review #3** (5-7 days) | Core content first |
| 7 | **Design Begins** | Wireframes (site + microsite), visual design concepts, brand application | **Review #4** (5-7 days) | Design direction approval |
| 8-9 | **Content Priority 2 & Design Refinement** | Program sections, pitch deck, sponsorship package, one-pager; high-fidelity comps, collateral designs | **Review #5** (5-7 days) | Final content & design approval |
| 10-11 | **Development & Production** | Website build, microsite, donation page, collateral finalization, SEO/analytics | Internal QA only | No client review required |
| 12 | **Testing, Training & Launch** | Cross-browser testing, staff training videos, final polish, soft launch | Final walkthrough Mar 28-29 | **Grant-ready: March 31** |

**Phase 1 total cost remains $25,000** with adjusted milestone payments: Contract signing (20% / $5k) → Strategy approval Week 4 (28% / $7k) → Content & Design approval Week 9 (32% / $8k) → Launch Week 12 (20% / $5k).

**Critical success factors:**
- Designate a single Tergar point person to consolidate feedback from all 5 internal reviewers
- Pre-schedule all review windows now
- Maintain 5-7 day maximum per review round
- Weekly 30-minute sync calls to maintain momentum

**Critical commitment:** All Phase 1 deliverables grant-ready by March 31. If latency is on the Tergar side, we absorb it without cost escalation. We get paid at milestones, not on the clock. Our incentive is perfectly aligned with yours: get it done right, get it done on time.

## Concern 7: Conversion Strategy Uncertainty

**What we heard:** Matt posed the question: donors first, then convert to retreat participants? Or build a retreat audience, then ask for money? He bet on donors first.

**How we solve it:**

Matt's instinct is correct, and here's the strategic framework behind it:

**The Capital Campaign Funnel (Now through 2027):**

```
Awareness → Interest → Cultivation → Ask → Gift → Stewardship → Retreat Conversion
```

The capital campaign is the primary engine for 2026. Every piece of collateral, every media placement, every website visit should drive toward one outcome: getting potential donors into Christy's pipeline. The website's primary call-to-action during quiet phase is not "book a retreat" — it's "learn about the vision" and "connect with us."

Once someone gives to the capital campaign, they become a warm lead for retreat participation. They're already emotionally and financially invested in the center. Post-campaign, the cultivation shifts: "You helped build it. Now come experience it."

**The Parallel Track (Quiet Phase):**

While the capital campaign is the main thrust, we simultaneously build the retreat audience through:
- SEO-optimized content about intensive meditation practice, three-year retreat, and contemplative neuroscience (organic discovery)
- Thought leadership pieces positioning Rinpoche and Tergar in contemplative science media
- Light social media presence establishing Samadhi's visual identity and the Portugal story

This content serves double duty: it builds retreat interest for the future and it provides credibility signals that donors see when they research the organization.

**The key insight:** These are not two separate strategies. They are one funnel with two exit points. The same awareness-building work feeds both donor cultivation and retreat interest. The difference is timing and call-to-action.

---

## Concern 8: Unproven Assumptions About Audience Geography

**What we heard:** Matt: "We've made a number of assumptions about how excited people will be to come fly to Portugal." He's right to question it. You don't know yet whether the US base will travel. Western Europe is likely the core geo, but it's unproven.

**How we solve it:**

We will build the messaging and digital infrastructure to test these assumptions rather than bet on them:

- **Website analytics with geo-tracking:** We'll know exactly where traffic is coming from and which pages convert by region. Within 90 days of launch, you'll have real data on geographic interest.

- **Audience-segmented messaging:** The website will speak to three geographic frames without committing to one:
  - **European practitioners:** "Your retreat center. A train ride away."
  - **US practitioners:** "Worth the journey. A place designed for transformation."
  - **Global audience:** "A destination for the world's most dedicated practitioners."

- **Test campaigns in Phase 2:** Once the brand foundation is set, we can run targeted awareness campaigns in specific European markets (UK, Germany, France, Benelux, Scandinavia) to measure response before committing major resources.

- **The science angle as geographic bridge:** Neuroscience research doesn't care about geography. If we position Samadhi as "the place where contemplative neuroscience happens," it draws an international audience that would travel anywhere for that experience.

**The honest answer:** You're right to be uncertain. Our job is to replace assumptions with data, and to build messaging flexible enough to work across geographies while we gather it.

---

## Concern 9: Organizational Complexity — Three Ships at Once

**What we heard:** US nonprofit, Portuguese for-profit subsidiary, capital campaign. Three distinct communications channels that must be aligned but separate.

**How we solve it:**

This is an information architecture problem, and Suede has solved it before in multi-stakeholder platforms. Here's the structure:

**One Website, Three Clear Pathways:**

- **Tergar Retreats (US Nonprofit):** The parent brand. About us, mission, team, news. This is the organizational credibility layer.
- **Samadhi Retreat Center (Portugal):** The place. Architecture, sustainability, programs, location, logistics. This lives as a section within the main site — not a separate site — so it benefits from the parent brand's SEO and authority.
- **Capital Campaign (Microsite):** The ask. Campaign story, naming opportunities, gift pyramid, progress tracker, donation page. Visually distinct but integrated with the main site navigation. Designed specifically for the fundraising conversion path.

**One Brand Voice, Three Registers:**

The messaging framework will define how the voice shifts across these three contexts:
- **Tergar Retreats US:** Organizational, professional, mission-driven. "We are building something unprecedented."
- **Samadhi Center:** Embodied, sensory, place-based. "Stone walls. Mountain air. Ancient practice."
- **Capital Campaign:** Aspirational, urgent, donor-centered. "Your gift builds the future of practice."

Same family. Different rooms.

---

## Concern 10: Resource & Bandwidth Constraints

**What we heard:** Matthew Zimwalt's time is at a premium. Christy's plate is overflowing. You need a team that can run with minimal hand-holding.

**How we solve it:**

This is why we structured the team the way we did. We are three senior people who do the work themselves. No account managers scheduling calls to discuss calls. No junior designers learning on your dime. No layers of approval on our side.

**What we need from you:**
- Christy or Zak in a weekly 30-minute check-in (cancel if not needed)
- Matthew Zimwalt for 2 brand discovery interviews (60 min each) and 2 leadership review sessions
- 5-business-day turnaround on small team reviews
- 7-10 business day turnaround on leadership reviews

**What we handle independently:**
- All strategy development, content creation, design, and development
- Project management and timeline tracking (Ian)
- Draft iterations between review rounds
- Technical implementation, hosting, SEO, analytics
- Staff training materials and documentation

We proposed the weekly-with-option-to-cancel cadence because it's the lightest-weight way to stay aligned. If a week has nothing to discuss, Christy gets 30 minutes back. If something needs attention, we don't wait two weeks to surface it.

## The Unanswered Questions

### "How much experience do you have supporting capital campaigns specifically?"

Matt asked this directly, and we want to answer it fully.

**Direct capital campaign experience:**

- **Suede designed the MetaCampus retreat center pitch deck** — investor-ready capital campaign materials for a retreat center project. This is as close to a 1:1 analog as exists. The MetaCampus deck includes fundraising narrative, financial projections, naming opportunities, and visual storytelling for a physical contemplative space. The Figma files are available for review.

- **Suede managed infrastructure and operations at Mystical Yoga Farm** in Guatemala (2014-2015) — a retreat center that required capital improvements, community fundraising, and donor cultivation in a resource-constrained environment. This is not theoretical knowledge; it's lived operational experience running a retreat facility.

- **Mikyo was a direct observer of a successful under-2-million-euro temple construction campaign** in his own Buddhist community (Zomlinggar). He tracked the full cycle: quiet phase cultivation, major gift solicitation from committed long-term students, and public phase fundraising. The lion's share came from committed practitioners who saw the significance of the vision — exactly the dynamic Tergar Retreats needs to replicate.

- **Suede wrote and won a $75K grant proposal** to Harmony Protocol for CryptoLumenati — demonstrating the ability to craft compelling foundation-grade narratives for mission-driven organizations.

**Transferable campaign experience:**

- **Mikyo built EigenLayer's community from zero to 150K+ Discord members** with a 6M token airdrop and ambassador program. While this is a different domain, the core mechanics are identical to a capital campaign: identify your highest-value supporters, cultivate them with exclusive access and insider status, give them tools to evangelize on your behalf, and convert their enthusiasm into tangible commitments. The scale and sophistication of this community build exceeds what most nonprofit agencies have ever attempted.

- **Mikyo grew Ritual Foundation's X following from 0 to 40K** and Discord from 35K to 100K+ — demonstrating the ability to build awareness and convert attention into engaged community from a cold start, which is precisely Tergar Retreats' situation with its 1,000-contact CRM.

**The honest framing:** We have not run a $3.5M nonprofit capital campaign for a Buddhist retreat center before. Neither has anyone. This specific project is unprecedented. But we have designed capital campaign materials for retreat centers, managed retreat center operations, observed successful Buddhist construction campaigns from the inside, won grant funding, and built communities at massive scale from zero. The combination of these experiences, plus our domain expertise in Buddhist organizational dynamics, is more relevant than a conventional agency's portfolio of capital campaigns for hospitals or universities.

### "How does the Web3/crypto background translate?"

Matt asked this, and Zak bridged it in the meeting, but let's make the case explicitly.

**The Web3-to-Sangha translation:**

| Web3 Skill | Tergar Application |
|---|---|
| Building communities around intangible value (tokens, protocols) | Building community around intangible value (meditation, wisdom, lineage) |
| Converting strangers into evangelists at scale | Converting curious newcomers into committed practitioners and donors |
| Creating belonging and identity in decentralized networks | Creating sangha cohesion across a global, distributed community |
| Designing token-gated experiences and tiered access | Designing donor recognition tiers and naming opportunities |
| Managing treasury and governance for DAOs | Understanding nonprofit governance and fund stewardship |
| Shipping under extreme uncertainty with distributed teams | Operating in the ambiguity of a startup nonprofit with a distributed mandala |
| Storytelling for abstract, complex value propositions | Communicating the value of intensive meditation practice to secular audiences |

**The reframe:** Web3 is the most competitive attention environment on the internet. Every project starts with nothing — no brand, no audience, no trust. You have to earn all of it through authentic storytelling and genuine engagement. That is exactly Tergar Retreats' situation: 1,000 contacts in a CRM, no established brand, no proven audience. The difference is that in Web3, Mikyo was building communities around financial protocols. Here, he's building community around something he's devoted his life to. The craft is the same. The stakes are higher. The motivation runs deeper.

**What we are NOT bringing:** We are not going to put Tergar Retreats on the blockchain. We are not going to issue tokens. We are not going to use crypto jargon in any donor-facing materials. The Web3 background is relevant because of the *skills* it produced — community building, narrative strategy, operating under uncertainty, and reaching new audiences from scratch — not because of the *technology* itself.

**What we ARE bringing from that world:** Two things. First, a battle-tested playbook for building communities from zero at massive scale — the same mechanics that grew EigenLayer from nothing to 150K+ members apply directly to growing Tergar Retreats from 1,000 CRM contacts to a thriving donor and practitioner base. Second, direct access to a network of high-net-worth tech and crypto individuals who are personally interested in meditation and consciousness, and who represent an entirely new donor segment for Tergar. This is the tech wealth play Matt mentioned, and Mikyo has the direct relationships to make it happen.

## The Small Team Advantage

Before we compare ourselves to anyone else, we want to make the structural case for why a team like ours is better for a project like yours than a larger agency — any larger agency.

**The people in this meeting are the people doing the work.**
No bait-and-switch. No handoff to junior staff after the contract is signed. Mikyo writes every word of copy. Suede designs every page and writes every line of code. Ian manages every milestone. There is no account manager relaying your feedback to a designer who relays it to a developer. The person who hears your vision is the person who executes it. That eliminates the game of telephone that kills most agency engagements.

**You will be our primary client.**
A larger agency juggles dozens of accounts. Your project competes for attention with their bigger retainers. When a conflict arises, guess which client gets the senior team's time? With us, Tergar Retreats is the main event for 2026. Your project gets our best thinking, our fastest response times, and our full creative energy. You are not one of thirty accounts. You are the account.

**Less expensive, more senior.**
Suede consolidates three roles — web developer, UX/UI designer, graphic designer — into one senior-level execution stream at $85/hour. A larger agency would staff those as three separate billable people, each with coordination overhead, each with handoff delays, each adding to the invoice. Our structure saves you money and delivers faster because there is zero translation loss between design and development. What you approve in Figma is what goes live. Matt said it in the meeting: the other option is "too much for the website" and "a little pricey" on campaign collateral. We deliver more for less because we've eliminated the bureaucracy.

**No learning curve on your world.**
A conventional nonprofit agency would need weeks of onboarding to understand the difference between Tergar International and Tergar Retreats, why "mandala" doesn't mean a coloring book, what three-year retreat actually entails, and why you can't just "ask the guru to do a TikTok." We walked into today's meeting and spoke your language. Mikyo was born into the Nyingma/Kagyu lineage. Suede has practiced for 25 years, lived in Tibetan Buddhist communities in India and Nepal, and managed a retreat center. That domain fluency is not something you can brief into an agency. It's years of lived experience that shows up in every design choice, every headline, and every strategic recommendation.

**We reduce your workload, not add to it.**
Larger agencies create process: more meetings, more approval layers, more "alignment sessions." We create output. Training videos so your staff can update the site. Editable Figma source files for every deliverable. Documented systems and templates you can reuse. We want Tergar Retreats to be self-sufficient when we're done, not dependent on us for every update. The goal is to build your capacity, not our retainer.

**We move fast and communicate clearly.**
Ian keeps the trains running. 24-48 hour response times. Weekly check-ins with the option to cancel. Milestone-based payment so you never pay ahead of delivered work. When you email on Tuesday, you hear back by Thursday at the latest — more likely same day. A larger agency's project manager is managing six other projects. Ours is managing yours.

**RaidGuild as a deep bench.**
We're a small team, but we're not isolated freelancers. RaidGuild is a decentralized collective of designers, developers, and strategists that has shipped $367M+ in infrastructure. If we ever need additional capacity — planned or unplanned — Ian can bring in vetted talent quickly. That's a safety net most small teams can't offer and most large agencies don't need because they just assign you whoever is available.

---

## Why Us Over the Other Agency

We will not name the other agency. But we will name the differences.

**They bring nonprofit experience. We bring this nonprofit's experience.**
They have built websites for social impact organizations. We have lived in Buddhist communities, managed retreat centers, practiced in Tibetan monasteries, designed capital campaign materials for retreat projects, and grown communities from zero to hundreds of thousands. The distance between "nonprofit experience" and "understanding why a mandala creates donor fatigue" is the distance between reading about meditation and sitting on a cushion.

**They are more expensive for less coverage.**
Matt said it in the meeting. Suede consolidates three roles into one senior-level execution stream. The budget you save on production goes to the brand strategy and marketing work that will actually differentiate Tergar Retreats. At $79K for a full year of strategy, design, development, content, PR, and project management — you are getting six functional roles delivered by three senior people with no overhead bloat.

**They cannot do brand strategy for this context.**
Zak said it: they don't have "a person on their team who has 25 years of living in community and operating it." Brand strategy for a Buddhist retreat center capital campaign is not the same as brand strategy for a food bank or a climate nonprofit. The nuances — how to talk about lineage without sounding cultish, how to present a teacher without creating a personality cult, how to ask for money in a tradition that values renunciation, how to differentiate within a mandala without creating competition — require someone who has navigated these tensions personally. Mikyo has. That fluency shows up in every word of copy and every strategic decision.

**They don't have retreat center operations experience.**
Suede managed infrastructure and operations at a retreat center in Guatemala. He didn't read about retreat centers — he ran one. He knows what staff need from a booking system, what visitors experience when they arrive, and what breaks down operationally when the marketing doesn't match the reality. That experience informs every design decision, every user flow, every piece of collateral.

**They are a larger agency. We are your embedded team.**
At a larger agency, you are a line item. With us, you are the mission. We show up weekly, we deliver between meetings, and we operate with enough autonomy that Christy's plate doesn't get heavier — it gets lighter. The people who care most about your project are the people doing the work.

## What Happens Next

We are ready to start the moment you say go. Here is what the first two weeks look like:

**Week 1:**
- Contract execution and kickoff call (60 min with full team)
- Brand discovery interview scheduling (3-5 stakeholders)
- Existing asset audit (website, video library, design system, CRM)
- Technical environment setup (WordPress staging site on WP Engine)

**Week 2:**
- Brand discovery interviews begin (isolated, one-on-one)
- Sitemap and information architecture draft
- Competitive positioning refinement
- Initial wireframe exploration

No waiting. No onboarding period. No ramp-up. We've already done the research. We've already studied your organization, your competitive landscape, your audience personas, and your existing digital presence. We are prepared.
