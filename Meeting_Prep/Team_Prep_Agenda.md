## 3. Our Core Differentiators -- What to Emphasize (5 min)

Agree as a team on the 3-4 things we want to make sure land in the meeting:

1. **We are practitioners, not just vendors.** Mikyo was born into the lineage. Suede has decades of practice and retreat center experience. Sasquatch has a personal practice and runs a community space. This isn't a gig -- it's a calling.

2. **We do strategy AND execution.** No translation loss between the plan and the work. The people in the room are the people doing the work.

3. **We've done this specific type of work before.** Capital campaign materials for a retreat center (Suede). Community building from zero to massive scale (Mikyo/RaidGuild). Website design and development (Suede/RaidGuild).

4. **We become part of their team.** We reduce strain, not add it. Training, templates, documentation, fast response times. We hand them the keys when we're done.

## 4. Role Assignments for the Tergar Meeting (5 min)

Decide who leads each part of the conversation:

| Topic | Lead | Support |
|-------|------|---------|
| Opening / personal connection to the work | Mikyo | All |
| Understanding their needs / asking questions | Sasquatch | All |
| Strategy and marketing approach | Mikyo | Suede |
| Design, website, production process | Suede | Mikyo |
| Timeline, logistics, working relationship | Sasquatch | All |
| Closing / next steps | Sasquatch | All |

**Key principle:** Let the conversation be natural. Don't over-script. But know who picks up which threads.

## 5. Questions We Want to Ask Tergar (5 min)

Review the questions on the meeting reference doc. Flag the top 5-7 we absolutely want to get to. Prioritize questions that:

- Show we've done our homework
- Help us understand what they really need (not just what the RFP says)
- Reveal what the other finalist might NOT ask
- Demonstrate we're thinking about their success, not just our scope

---

## 6. Potential Concerns and How to Address Them (5 min)

Anticipate what they might push on:

| They Might Ask / Worry About | Our Response |
|------|------|
| "You're a small team -- can you handle this?" | We're lean by design. The people in this room do the work. No handoff to junior staff. And we have RaidGuild as a deep bench for dev support. |
| "Your background is web3/crypto -- is that relevant?" | Web3 is the most competitive attention environment on the internet. We built communities from zero in that space. Those skills transfer directly -- community building, storytelling, trust-based engagement. |
| "How do we know you understand nonprofit / dharma marketing?" | Mikyo grew up in the lineage. Suede has designed capital campaign materials for a retreat center and managed one. We understand the sacred responsibility of this work. |
| "Your price -- is there flexibility?" | We can discuss scope adjustments, but we've priced this to deliver real value without cutting corners. We're also open to phased approaches. |
| "What happens if something goes wrong or timelines slip?" | We build in check-ins at every milestone. Sasquatch manages the timeline. If something shifts, we communicate immediately and adjust together. |

## 7. Final Alignment (4 min)

- **Tone for the meeting:** Warm, confident, genuine. Not salesy. We're here because we care about this work.
- **Listen more than we talk.** Especially in the first 15 minutes. Let them tell us what they need.
- **Don't oversell.** Don't promise things we'd figure out after getting the work. Stay high-level on specifics we don't know yet.
- **Be human.** Share why this matters to each of us personally. That's what separates us from the other finalist.
- **End with clarity.** Ask about their decision timeline and what else they need from us.

*Let's go in there and be ourselves. That's our best pitch.*
