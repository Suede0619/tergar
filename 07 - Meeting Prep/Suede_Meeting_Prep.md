# Suede's Meeting Prep
## Personal Preparation for the Tergar Interview

## Your Role in This Meeting

You are the **design and production backbone** of this team. You're the one who turns strategy into tangible things people can see, use, and feel. In a project about building a digital presence and capital campaign materials, that makes you central.

You also carry something the other two don't: **hands-on retreat center operations experience** and **capital campaign design work for a nearly identical project**. Don't undersell this.

## Before the Meeting: Review These

1. **The proposal itself** -- especially the Phase 1 scope under your name: website rebuild, capital campaign collateral (case for support, donor pitch deck, naming/sponsorship package, gift pyramid, one-pager), donation integration, staff training videos
2. **Your scope doc:** https://hackmd.io/@SasquatchTru/rkT6LUuXWx -- know your deliverables cold
3. **The MetaCampus pitch deck** -- be ready to reference it if they ask about capital campaign experience. Have it open in a tab.
4. **The RaidGuild website** -- your most recent full-cycle project (Figma > dev > design system). Have it open.
5. **Tergar's current website** (tergar.org) -- browse it. Note what works, what feels dated, what you'd improve. Don't volunteer criticism, but be ready if they ask "what would you change?"
6. **The user personas doc** -- know the four audiences (major donors, grant officers, future retreatants, serious practitioners). Your design work has to serve all of them.
7. **The landscape analysis** -- at least skim it. Knowing how Tergar compares to Spirit Rock, Plum Village, Tara Mandala, etc. shows you understand the space, not just the pixels.

## Questions You Might Get Asked -- And How to Answer

### About Your Design and Technical Skills

**Q: "Walk us through your process for a website rebuild like this."**

A: "I start with discovery -- understanding your audiences, your content, and your goals. Then I move into information architecture and wireframes so we align on structure before any visual design happens. From there I design in Figma, get your feedback, and build in WordPress. I've done this 30+ times over 14 years. The key is that I do design AND development -- there's no handoff between a designer and a developer where things get lost in translation. What you approve in Figma is what goes live."

**Q: "Why WordPress? Have you considered other platforms?"**

A: "WordPress powers over 40% of the web and is the strongest choice for a nonprofit that needs to own its content, manage donations, integrate booking systems like Retreat Guru, and maintain the site independently after we're done. I've built 30+ WordPress sites. I'll also do a platform evaluation in discovery to confirm it's the right fit -- but given your needs, I'm confident it is. I'll also train your team with tutorial videos so you're never dependent on us for basic updates."

**Q: "What's your experience with donation pages and fundraising integrations?"**

A: "I've built donation systems with Stripe and PayPal integration, including recurring giving options. The key is reducing friction -- a donor who's inspired shouldn't have to click through five pages. I design donation flows that are clean, trustworthy, and conversion-optimized. If you're using a specific CRM or donor management system, I can evaluate integration options during discovery."

**Q: "How do you handle multiple audiences on one website?"**

A: "This is one of the core design challenges for Tergar -- you have major donors, grant officers, future retreatants, and serious practitioners all arriving at the same front door. The answer is smart information architecture: clear navigation paths, audience-aware landing pages, and a visual hierarchy that guides each visitor to what matters to them without overwhelming anyone. I've designed multi-stakeholder platforms before, including sites serving 4+ distinct user types."

**Q: "Can you tell us about the design system you created for RaidGuild?"**

A: "Full-cycle project -- I designed it in Figma, built the website, and published a standalone design system at brand.raidguild.org. The design system ensures visual consistency across all touchpoints. For Tergar, I'd build the same kind of foundation: a cohesive system of colors, typography, components, and templates that your team can use to maintain consistency whether it's a social graphic, an email, or a donor deck."

### About Your Capital Campaign Experience

**Q: "You mention capital campaign experience for a retreat center. Tell us more."**

A: "I designed the full capital campaign materials for MetaCampus -- a retreat center project with a remarkably similar vision to what you're building in Portugal. That included an investor-ready pitch deck with fundraising narrative visualization, financial graphics, and a compelling visual story. I understand the specific challenge: you're asking people to invest in something that doesn't physically exist yet, so the materials have to make the vision feel real and inevitable. That's a design problem as much as a narrative one."

**Q: "What goes into a strong Case for Support document?"**

A: "A Case for Support has to do three things: establish urgency (why now), paint the vision (what this becomes), and build credibility (why this team can deliver). Visually, it needs to feel premium without being flashy -- donors at this level can smell inauthenticity. I'd use photography, clean typography, restrained color, and let the story breathe. The design should feel like Tergar -- grounded, spacious, trustworthy."

**Q: "How do you approach designing a donor pitch deck?"**

A: "The deck is the tool your team carries into the room. It has to support the conversation, not replace it. That means bold visuals, minimal text, clear financial graphics, and a narrative arc that builds to the ask. I've designed investor and donor decks across multiple sectors. The key for Tergar is honoring the gravitas of the lineage while making the financial case clearly and professionally."

### About Your Contemplative Background

**Q: "Tell us about your connection to contemplative practice."**

A: "I have over 25 years of practice across multiple traditions -- Shambhala Training in Boulder, a 10-day Vipassana sit at Dhamma Giri in India, Zen training at Great Dharma Chan Monastery, and Medical Qigong. In 2013 I spent six months living in Buddhist and spiritual communities across India and Nepal -- ISKCON in Mumbai, Amma's Ashram in Kerala, a Vipassana center in Igatpuri, and a monastery in Kathmandu. I also trekked the Annapurna Circuit and Everest Three Passes during that time. This isn't an intellectual interest for me -- it's the foundation of my life."

**Q: "You managed a retreat center?"**

A: "Yes -- the Mystical Yoga Farm on Lake Atitlan in Guatemala, 2014-2015. I handled infrastructure management, farm operations, payroll, and supplies procurement. It gave me a ground-level understanding of what it takes to run a practice center -- the logistics, the community dynamics, the daily operational reality. That experience informs my design work because I understand what retreat staff actually need from their website, their booking systems, and their marketing materials. I'm not guessing."

**Q: "How does your spiritual background influence your design work?"**

A: "It makes me a better listener. I understand the weight of this work -- you're not selling a product, you're creating a gateway to the dharma. The design has to honor that. It needs to feel spacious, not cluttered. Trustworthy, not trendy. I approach this work with the same care I'd bring to practice itself -- attention to detail, respect for the tradition, and an understanding that every design choice communicates something about the lineage."

### About the Team and Working Relationship

**Q: "How do you and Mikyo divide the work?"**

A: "Clean split. Mikyo leads strategy, messaging, content, marketing, and PR. I lead design, website development, and production. We overlap in discovery and strategy -- we both contribute to the master narrative and messaging frameworks. But when it comes to execution, there's no ambiguity. Mikyo writes the words, I design the experience. We've worked together and our styles complement each other well."

**Q: "How do you handle feedback and revisions?"**

A: "We've built two revision rounds into every web asset and one round per strategy deliverable. I present work in Figma first so you can comment directly on designs before anything gets built. I'd rather get it right in wireframes than rebuild a page. I also won't disappear between check-ins -- Sasquatch keeps the schedule tight and I maintain a 24-48 hour response time."

**Q: "What happens after you leave? Can we maintain everything ourselves?"**

A: "That's the goal. I build in WordPress specifically so your team can manage content without a developer. I'll create eight tutorial videos walking your staff through every CMS function they'll need. All source files -- Figma, editable formats -- are included with every deliverable. And during the Phase 2 retainer, I'm still available for updates, new materials, and support. You'll never be stranded."

### Potentially Tricky Questions

**Q: "What's your availability? Are you working on other projects simultaneously?"**

A: "Tergar is my priority commitment for 2026. January through March is an intensive sprint to hit the grant deadline, and April through December I'm on retainer with dedicated hours each month. I structure my workload to protect this project's timeline."

**Q: "Your background mentions web3 and crypto. How is that relevant here?"**

A: "The design and development skills are identical -- Figma, WordPress, responsive design, user experience, brand systems. The web3 work sharpened those skills in a high-pressure environment where everything ships fast and the bar for visual quality is extremely high. For Tergar, what matters is 14 years of WordPress, 30+ sites built, and direct experience designing capital campaign materials for a retreat center. The web3 context is where I honed the craft, but the craft itself is exactly what you need."

**Q: "We're a small nonprofit with limited budget. How do we know we're getting enough of your time?"**

A: "My scope is detailed to the deliverable level -- you can see exactly what you're getting and when. The milestone-based payment structure means you're never paying ahead of delivered work. And because I do design, UX, and development, you're getting three roles for the cost of one. That's real value compression."

## Your Strongest Cards -- Play Them

These are the things that only you bring to this team. Find moments to surface them naturally:

1. **You've designed capital campaign materials for a retreat center before.** This is your ace. The other finalist almost certainly hasn't.

2. **You've managed a retreat center.** You understand the operational reality -- the booking systems, the logistics, the community needs. Your design decisions are informed by lived experience.

3. **You consolidate three roles.** Developer + UX/UI designer + graphic designer. No coordination overhead, no translation loss. This saves them money and time.

4. **25+ years of contemplative practice, including time in India and Nepal.** You won't need onboarding into the dharma world. There's no learning curve on Tibetan Buddhist terminology, community structure, or the sacred responsibility of this work.

5. **30+ WordPress sites over 14 years.** This is not your first rodeo. You've built nonprofit sites, wellness sites, tech sites. You know the platform cold.

6. **You create self-sufficiency.** Training videos, editable source files, documented systems. You hand them the keys.

## Things to Avoid

- Don't get pulled into technical details (specific plugins, hosting specs, CSS frameworks). If asked, say "I'll evaluate the best technical stack during discovery -- I want to make the right call based on your actual needs, not assumptions."
- Don't volunteer what's wrong with their current site unless directly asked. If asked, be diplomatic: "There's a solid foundation. I see opportunities to strengthen the visual hierarchy and streamline the user journey for your different audiences."
- Don't overshadow Mikyo on strategy and messaging -- that's his lane. Support him, add to the conversation, but don't lead those topics.
- Don't downplay your retreat center experience or spiritual background. In this room, with this client, it's not a soft credential -- it's your hardest differentiator.

## If You Get Nervous

You've designed 30+ websites. You've designed campaign materials for a retreat center. You've managed a retreat center. You've practiced for 25+ years. You've lived in monasteries in India and Nepal. You've trekked to Everest.

You are exactly the right person for this work. That's not a pitch -- it's true.

Just be yourself.
