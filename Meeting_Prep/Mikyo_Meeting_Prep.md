# Mikyo's Meeting Prep
## Personal Preparation for the Tergar Interview

---

## Your Role in This Meeting

You are the **strategic and narrative center** of this team. Marketing strategy, brand storytelling, content, PR, community building -- it all runs through you. You also carry the deepest personal lineage connection to this work: born to two first-generation Western Dzogchen practitioners, formally practicing in Nyingma and Kagyu lineages since age 20. That's not a bullet point -- it's the reason this project found you.

In a room where the client is a Tibetan Buddhist organization deciding who to trust with their story, you are the most credible voice they'll hear today.

## Before the Meeting: Review These

1. **Your scope doc:** https://hackmd.io/@SasquatchTru/H1oe8Ud7Wl -- know your deliverables cold: master narrative, messaging frameworks, content pillars, website copy, campaign narrative, PR strategy, donor materials content
2. **The proposal** -- especially the Phase 1 timeline (Weeks 1-9) and Phase 2 retainer structure. You own the content and strategy side of every deliverable.
3. **The user personas doc** -- you wrote strategy for these audiences. Be ready to talk about the four segments fluently: major donors, grant officers, future retreatants, serious practitioners
4. **The landscape analysis** -- be prepared to reference how Tergar is positioned vs. Spirit Rock, Plum Village, Shambhala, IMS, FPMT. Your strategic credibility shows when you can articulate Tergar's unique advantages without being asked.
5. **Tergar's current website** (tergar.org) -- browse it. Note the messaging, the tone, the content gaps. You'll want an opinion on the narrative, not just the design.
6. **The EigenLayer documentary** (https://youtu.be/88xtAo6kXHg) -- have the link ready. It's your most compressed example of brand strategy made tangible.
7. **The Ritual website and X account** -- your most recent growth story (0 to 40K followers, 35K to 100K+ Discord). Have numbers in your head.

## Questions You Might Get Asked -- And How to Answer

### About Strategy and Narrative

**Q: "How would you approach developing Tergar's master narrative?"**

A: "I'd start with a listening phase -- stakeholder interviews, audience research, and immersion in the materials you already have. The narrative already exists in Rinpoche's teachings, in the vision for the retreat center, in the community's lived experience. My job isn't to invent a story -- it's to distill the one that's already there into a framework that resonates across all your audiences. A major donor needs to feel the legacy. A 30-year-old finding you on Instagram needs to feel the invitation. The master narrative has to hold both of those without diluting either."

**Q: "What are content pillars and how would you define ours?"**

A: "Content pillars are the 3-5 core themes that anchor everything you publish -- every blog post, social caption, email, press release maps back to one of them. For Tergar, they'd likely emerge around themes like: the intersection of science and wisdom, the accessibility of the path, the vision for the physical center, community and belonging, and the personal transformation of practice. But I wouldn't define them in a vacuum. They come out of discovery -- what's Rinpoche already saying, what's resonating with your community, where are the gaps."

**Q: "How do you approach messaging for donors vs. the general public?"**

A: "Donors want to invest in legacy and impact. They need to see vision, credibility, and competent execution. The general public -- especially younger seekers -- want authenticity and an invitation that doesn't feel institutional or intimidating. Same story, different emphasis. The capital campaign narrative leads with 'this is what we're building and why it matters for generations.' The public-facing content leads with 'this is what you've been looking for and here's your way in.' My job is to hold the through-line so it all feels like one voice."

**Q: "What would your marketing strategy look like for the quiet phase vs. the public launch?"**

A: "The quiet phase is about precision, not volume. We're speaking to a small number of high-value donors and foundations. The materials need to be impeccable -- the Case for Support, the pitch deck, the website as a credibility check. No public noise, no social campaigns. Just the right story in the right hands. The public launch flips that -- it's about reach, awareness, and emotion. Compelling visual storytelling, press placements, social content that makes people feel something. I'd build the strategy as a phased escalation: quiet cultivation, then pre-launch buzz, then a coordinated public moment."

**Q: "How would you handle PR for a project like this?"**

A: "Tergar has natural media angles that most nonprofits would kill for: a globally recognized teacher, a neuroscience-validated approach to meditation, a stunning retreat center in Portugal, and a story about ancient wisdom meeting the modern crisis of attention. I'd develop a press kit framework in Phase 1, identify target outlets and journalists, and pitch selectively during the quiet phase to set up coverage for the public launch. The goal is 3-5 press placements -- quality over quantity. Podcasts are also a strong channel for Rinpoche's voice."

**Q: "You mention '1,000 True Fans' in the proposal. What does that mean for Tergar?"**

A: "It's a concept from Kevin Kelly -- you don't need millions of followers, you need 1,000 people who are deeply committed. For Tergar, that's the core sangha plus new allies who become true advocates: recurring donors, retreat participants, people who share the content because they believe in it, not because they were targeted by an ad. My community building experience is about cultivating that kind of depth. At EigenLayer I built a community from zero -- 150K+ Discord members, a 6-million-token airdrop, an ambassador program. The mechanics are different for a dharma organization, but the principle is the same: authentic engagement creates organic growth."

### About Your Background and Experience

**Q: "Tell us about your connection to this tradition."**

A: "I was born into it. Both of my parents are first-generation Western Dzogchen practitioners. I grew up in this world -- the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages aren't something I studied as an adult, they're the ground I was raised on. I began practicing formally at 20. This project isn't a professional opportunity for me -- it's a continuation of something my parents started. When I read the RFP, I didn't see a client brief. I saw my life's work."

**Q: "Your career has been in web3 and crypto. How is that relevant to a Buddhist nonprofit?"**

A: "Web3 is where I learned to build communities around intangible value in the most competitive attention environment on the internet. Every project starts with nothing -- no brand, no audience, no trust. You have to earn all of it through authentic storytelling and genuine engagement. That's exactly what Tergar needs. The skills transfer directly: narrative strategy, community architecture, growth from zero, donor/investor cultivation, brand positioning. The difference is that in web3 I was building communities around financial protocols. Here, I'm building community around something I've devoted my life to. The craft is the same. The stakes are higher. The motivation runs deeper."

**Q: "Tell us about the EigenLayer community work."**

A: "I was Head of Community at EigenLayer. I built the community from scratch -- designed the ambassador program, orchestrated a 6-million-token airdrop to 150K+ members, grew a Discord to over 100K, and co-directed a microdocumentary that distilled the project's brand story. The documentary is probably the most compressed example of how I work: deep brand strategy upstream, then a piece of content that makes people feel something. I'd bring that same approach to Tergar -- understand the story deeply first, then find the right formats to share it."

**Q: "What about your work at Ritual?"**

A: "At Ritual I grew the foundation's X account from 0 to 40K followers and the Discord from 35K to over 100K members. I also led a full website redesign. This was a highly technical project -- crypto meets AI -- and the challenge was making something complex feel accessible and compelling. That's a direct parallel to Tergar's challenge: making profound wisdom accessible without dumbing it down."

**Q: "You've built agencies before. How is this different?"**

A: "I've built two creative agencies and led marketing at two venture-backed startups. What's different here is that I'm not selling a service -- I'm offering a skill set in service of something I believe in at the deepest level. I've spent my career developing these tools. This project is what they were for."

### About Content and Execution

**Q: "Who writes the website copy?"**

A: "I do. Homepage, program sections, about pages, campaign microsite content, navigation copy, SEO optimization -- that's all in my scope. I write in close collaboration with your team to make sure the voice is authentically Tergar's, not mine. I'll draft, you'll review, we'll refine. Two revision rounds per asset."

**Q: "What's your approach to SEO?"**

A: "SEO for Tergar is about being findable by the right people. Someone searching 'meditation retreat Portugal' or 'Tibetan Buddhist retreat center' needs to find you. I'll optimize meta titles, descriptions, and keywords across the site and work with Suede to make sure the technical SEO foundation is solid -- site speed, mobile performance, structured data. It's not about gaming algorithms. It's about making sure the people who are looking for you can find you."

**Q: "How do you approach email and social content?"**

A: "Email is your highest-trust channel -- these are people who raised their hand. I'd build a nurture sequence for new subscribers and a regular cadence for the community. Social is about showing, not telling. Short-form content that embodies the teachings -- moments of practice, the beauty of the land in Portugal, Rinpoche's words in accessible formats. I'd develop a content calendar mapped to your campaign phases and adjust based on what resonates."

**Q: "How do you measure success?"**

A: "Phase 1 success is tangible: website live by February 28, campaign collateral grant-ready by March 15, 3-5 grant applications submitted by March 31. Phase 2 is about momentum: website traffic growth (2-3x baseline), email list growth, 50-100 retreat inquiries, 3-5 press placements, and building the foundation for your '1,000 True Fans.' I track everything with analytics and report quarterly, but I also care about qualitative signals -- is the Tergar team feeling supported? Are the materials working in actual donor conversations? Metrics matter, but so does the lived experience of using what we build."

### About the Team Dynamic

**Q: "How do you and Suede divide the work?"**

A: "I own words and strategy. Suede owns design and production. We both contribute to discovery and the master narrative, but execution is cleanly divided. I write the Case for Support narrative; Suede designs it. I write the website copy; Suede builds the site. I write the pitch deck messaging; Suede designs the deck. There's no ambiguity and no overlap. We reinforce each other."

**Q: "You're the marketing lead. What does that actually mean day-to-day?"**

A: "It means I'm the person thinking about your story and how to get it in front of the right people. Day-to-day that's writing content, developing strategy documents, pitching press, building email sequences, and keeping the narrative consistent across every touchpoint. During Phase 1, it's intensive -- multiple deliverables per week. During Phase 2, it's a steady rhythm of content creation, media outreach, and strategic adjustments based on what's working."

### Potentially Tricky Questions

**Q: "You're clearly passionate about this. Can you be objective?"**

A: "My connection to the tradition makes me more rigorous, not less. I understand what's at stake -- the dharma is not a product to be marketed carelessly. That means I hold a higher standard for authenticity and accuracy than someone without that background. I'll push back if something feels off, and I'll advocate for messaging that honors the lineage. That's a feature, not a risk."

**Q: "Your community building numbers are impressive, but those are crypto communities. Buddhist practitioners are different."**

A: "The demographics are different. The principles aren't. Trust, authenticity, shared values, genuine engagement, making people feel they belong to something meaningful. That's what builds any community. The difference is that in crypto, I had to create those values from scratch. Tergar already has them -- an unbroken lineage, a beloved teacher, and a community of people whose lives have been transformed. My job is to extend what already exists to the people who haven't found it yet."

**Q: "What if Rinpoche's team or senior students push back on messaging?"**

A: "I welcome that. They know the teachings far more deeply than I do. My role is to translate, not to reinterpret. If a senior student tells me a piece of messaging misrepresents the tradition, that's a gift. I'd build that feedback loop into the process from the start."

## Your Strongest Cards -- Play Them

1. **Born into the lineage.** No other marketing professional in the world has this combination: Nyingma/Kagyu lineage from birth, formal practice since 20, AND a career building communities at scale. That's not a coincidence. That's preparation.

2. **Community from zero, at massive scale.** EigenLayer (150K+ Discord, 6M token airdrop, ambassador program). Ritual (0 to 40K followers, 35K to 100K+ Discord). You know how to build.

3. **Strategy AND execution.** You're not a strategist who hands off to a copywriter. You write the words. You build the frameworks. You pitch the press. The person thinking about the strategy is the person doing the work.

4. **The documentary as proof.** The EigenLayer micro-doc is the most compressed evidence of how you work: deep strategy upstream, compelling storytelling downstream. Have the link ready.

5. **You understand the sacred responsibility.** You know the difference between marketing a product and serving a lineage. Say it in the meeting. It will land.

6. **Graduate-level research in digital organizing.** Your Fielding Graduate University work on decentralized organizing, self-governance, and network states gives you an intellectual framework that goes beyond marketing tactics.

## Things to Avoid

- Don't dominate the conversation. You have the most to say, but this is a three-person team. Make space for Suede on design and production, and Sasquatch on process and logistics.
- Don't over-reference web3/crypto without translating it. Every mention should immediately connect to what it means for Tergar. "At EigenLayer I did X -- and for Tergar that means Y."
- Don't make it sound like you have all the answers already. Discovery exists for a reason. Use phrases like "I'd want to learn from your team first" and "That's something we'd refine during discovery."
- Don't make promises about specific outcomes (exact follower counts, guaranteed press placements). Talk about the process, the approach, and the track record. Let them infer the outcomes.
- Don't get emotional in a way that feels performative. Your connection to the lineage is real. Let it come through naturally. Understatement is more powerful than a speech.

## The Thing Only You Can Say

At some point in this meeting, there will be a moment where it's right to say something like:

*"I didn't find this project through a job board. This is the work my whole life has been preparing me for. My parents were among the first Westerners to practice Dzogchen. I grew up in this world. And I've spent the last decade learning how to build communities at scale. This is the first time in my career where those two things converge completely. I don't take that lightly."*

Say it when the moment is right. Not rehearsed. Not at the top. When they ask why this matters to you, or when the conversation gets real. That's when it lands.

---

*You're not pitching. You're coming home. Let them feel that.*
