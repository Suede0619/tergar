[0:04] **Zak**: Actually, should we run one on our side, guys? Is that a. I can also send it? Yeah, send it to me after.

[0:11] **Mikyö Clark**: That'd be great.

[0:12] **Christy Gillham**: Thank you.

[0:14] **Matt Breit**: Great. Boom, boom, boom.

[0:15] **Zak**: Well, guys, do we want to do. I realize some of us have met, some of us hadn't. Haven't. Do we want to do just like, a quick round of intros and hellos? I guess I can kick us off here and then I'll just pass it around popcorn style. But I'm Zak, I'm working for Turgar Retreats. I have worked with literally all of you before in some capacity, so it's such a joy to bring everybody together.

[0:40] **Zak**: My role for this is probably going to be producer side, so client side just helping figure out how we solve our problems, what we need. Working directly with Christy, who's our head of fundraising and development, to kind of, I guess, support what she needs to get done, because she's already got a plate that's full and a second plate waiting to be dumped on top. And I'll just kick it over to you, Christy, if you want to do the next one.

[1:05] **Christy Gillham**: Yeah, it's so nice to meet everybody. As Zach said, I'm also with Tergo Retreats and working on their development and fundraising. I've been with the organization for going on eight months, and we're at this exciting phase where we're in the quiet phase, actually, of our capital campaign and realizing we really need to build out our infrastructure. So our website, our marketing, all of our campaign collateral, before we do a public launch. And our goal with the Capital Campaign is to raise 3.5 million, hopefully in the next three, five years max.

[1:40] **Christy Gillham**: So we have a lot of work to do, and that's why we're looking at engaging marketing agencies that can help us, at least with these initial first, second phases of getting a website up and going, helping with the collateral, and then really exploring some marketing avenues as well.

[2:00] **Zak**: Christy, pick the next person.

[2:02] **Christy Gillham**: Matty.

[2:08] **Matt Breit**: Cool. Matt, you guys, some of you know me, maybe we haven't met before. At the moment, I'm actually holding most of the finance and HR stuff, but I'm sort of playing a support role here in terms of assessing marketing agencies, marketing scopes, and stuff like that, just because my background is that I ran a successful agency in New York for many years. Miky Clark: and have worked in the nonprofit space before, so just here to just here to be a support.

[2:34] **Zak**: And he's going to pass it to Ian.

[2:40] **Ian Boucher**: Yeah, hi everybody. Good to see you again, Zak. Good to see you again, Matt. And nice to meet you, Christy. I am coming to you from the Reggio group. I've been working with them for going on five years now, just doing basic project management and account management for the freelancers of the guild. And personally very excited about this opportunity.

[3:06] **Mikyö Clark**: And.

[3:08] **Ian Boucher**: Getting to learn more about Kyrgar.

[3:10] **Mikyö Clark**: And.

[3:12] **Ian Boucher**: I think in general it would be very interesting and nice to work on a project that's so.

[3:22] **Mikyö Clark**: That's so.

[3:23] **Ian Boucher**: Impactful in a different way, kind of bringing us back down to earth. And so excited for the opportunity, excited for the chance to work with Miky and Suede again.

[3:35] **Mikyö Clark**: So happy to be here.

[3:38] **Ian Boucher**: Let's go to Miky.

[3:40] **Mikyö Clark**: Nice. Yeah, great to meet you, Christy. I guess Zak, obviously we've overlapped in different contexts. Yeah, I'm excited as well. Yeah, also excited to like dig in a bit deeper beyond the kind of RFP. Yeah, I have a background in marketing and storytelling and have played various roles in and out of the cryptoverse, which is some of what threads us together, but I'm also like a bit of a Dharma brat or second generation, sochen practitioner. So that's kind of been a through line of my life.

[4:22] **Mikyö Clark**: And yeah, I've been aware of Miky, Clark, Christy Gillham, Ian Boucher, Zak, Matt Breit, Miky Clark, and his brothers and his father for a long time. His father was kind of close with my root teacher, so there's some, some good overlap there. And also, yeah, been kind of tracking through Matt and Zak some of the work that's emerged here and super exciting stuff. So yeah, I think there's a lot more that we can get into, but that's a good enough intro. Suede, I'll pass to you.

[4:52] **Suede**: Hey, good morning, everybody. Nice to meet you, Christy. Nice to meet you, Matt. I'm Suede. I live in the Colorado Mountains up in the Arkansas River Valley. I have been doing design and production for the internet for decades. My role on this project is production artist, UX/UI designer and graphic designer.

[5:22] **Zak**: Which.

[5:23] **Suede**: Kind of means Miky writes the words and I make it. Make it visible, I build it. And yeah, I'm excited to work on this project. I've been practicing various Eastern philosophy and religions for many years and they're an.

[5:48] **Matt Breit**: Important part of my life.

[5:49] **Suede**: And I'm excited to bring this retreat opportunity Yeah, to your audience and to the Tergar community and to people who will be joining because of the work that we do, joining and participating and learning about Tergar. And that's all I got.

[6:09] **Mikyö Clark**: Thank you.

[6:12] **Zak**: Thanks everybody. And I'm actually realizing too, Christy, Miky is my friend in questown who I've been talking about in Suede used to be in Boulder. So I forgot that this is the overlap of Oh my goodness.

[6:26] **Christy Gillham**: Oh, that's wonderful. I'm in Nederland, Colorado, and then I have a place in Crestone as well. And then my partner's place is in Boulder, so we got all the areas covered.

[6:35] **Mikyö Clark**: That's sweet. Yeah.

[6:36] **Suede**: Yes, we're actually going to meet you.

[6:39] **Matt Breit**: In person as well.

[6:40] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, yeah. Through this process, we're like, oh, we're an hour away from each other.

[6:44] **Matt Breit**: That's cool.

[6:45] **Christy Gillham**: Oh, we're definitely going to have to get together.

[6:47] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, that's awesome.

[6:49] **Christy Gillham**: Amazing.

[6:51] **Mikyö Clark**: Miky Clark: Nice.

[6:51] **Zak**: Amazing. Well, thanks for the intros, everybody. I think, you know, Christy, I'm also happy to let you lead here. I think the reason we wanted to have this call was as we were starting to go through our marketing agencies, we've kind of narrowed it down to just a couple possibilities, and y'all are one of them. We had a couple meetings with the other groups, and as we were trying to narrow it down, we were like, oh my God, like, Miky and Suede's backgrounds are really perfect. There's a lot of experience here as well.

[7:20] **Zak**: So it felt like we should have a conversation with you all as we're trying to decide what agency we want to go with. And then maybe also explore some other avenues that we could go down if we didn't do a full, we've got like seven projects smuggled underneath this one RFP. So trying to figure out if maybe there's other opportunities to work together or piecemeal some of this stuff was, part of the thinking.

[7:46] **Zak**: Yeah, so I mean, I guess Christy, do you have an idea of how you'd like to go through and talk about the RFP?

[7:54] **Christy Gillham**: Yeah, thanks, Zak. And I apologize again, I'm on the road, so I'm not as prepared as I would like to be as unexpected. But to Zak's point, yeah, we've gotten to this part in the process where we're really trying to figure out who's our best partner. And I don't know if there's anything maybe that you guys would want to go through initially with the proposal that you submitted just for greater clarity, or if it would be more helpful for us to say, you know, we're really looking at, you know, brand narrative messaging right now.

[8:22] **Christy Gillham**: I think that's certainly an area that, you know, we'd want to explore. Absolutely. The website build is another area. The capital campaign collateral, that's another area. So I think those are really, like, the top 3. And Matt and Zak, correct me if I'm wrong, that we were kind of circling around is, like, really important for this first phase that we would like to explore the potential of collaborating with you all on. So I don't know if that's a good place to start or yeah, happy to take the lead.

[8:53] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, I think that's good. It would be great, I think, to get just a little bit more context. Obviously, part of this is like, okay, our team's overloaded and we need a partner that can take on certain chunks of work and kind of own those. But yeah, I mean, in terms of the brand strategy stuff, for example.

[9:20] **Matt Breit**: Maybe.

[9:20] **Mikyö Clark**: Tell us a little bit about kind of where that's living now and where you want to take it and kind of what the real opportunity is there.

[9:32] **Christy Gillham**: I would say, I mean, we're at the very ground level with it. We have a website that has some messaging on it, but we really don't have a brand narrative guideline messaging framework in place. I know Matthew Zimwalt, our executive director, is just a wealth of knowledge, is our knowledge base, and kind of is the voice.

[9:51] **Christy Gillham**: So we have a lot of, you know, collateral that we've done in a library asset video that has some great messaging and wording, but it hasn't been put together in a way that we can then start using it, for example, like the website or outreach or marketing or even to kind of use as a base for building out our campaign collateral. So we're really just at this point of infancy where we need to just nail it down. What is our mission? Who are we? What is the voice of Turgor Retreats?

[10:18] **Christy Gillham**: So I would say we're at the ground level.

[10:21] **Mikyö Clark**: That's great.

[10:22] **Matt Breit**: Yeah.

[10:22] **Christy Gillham**: Is that fair, Zach and Matt?

[10:27] **Ian Boucher**: Yeah.

[10:31] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, I love working at that level because the you get to be the most creative. And tell me a bit how that kind of the Retreats brand is situated. Obviously there's like parag.org and there's like kind of this brand family, let's call it. Yeah. How do you see the relationship between those?

[10:57] **Christy Gillham**: Yeah, it's a great question. And it is. It's a brand family. So it's like the Turgur name is well known, but Turgur Retreat specifically isn't. And so that's where we really need to build out our voice our credibility. So people knows Turgar retreats, not just Turgar. And I think there is a lot of confusion and noise in what is Turgar and how does this mandala is how it's referred to of organizations interlate.

[11:22] **Christy Gillham**: So I think there's some opportunity to cut through a lot of confusion to really educate people on who Turgar retreats is individually, but as it relates to the whole as well. So I think there's kind of a lot of groundwork to be laid and done there in terms of education and awareness.

[11:39] **Mikyö Clark**: And obviously, like our work together on brand strategy would refine this, but if you had to kind of distill that in a very simple form for the purposes of this call, how would you articulate that relationship? Yeah.

[11:53] **Christy Gillham**: We are just one of the one of the organizations within the mandala of organizations all led under the guidance of YMR. And our focus is practice and retreat. So meditation.

[12:06] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah. Yeah. So it really is like the practice brand, let's say.

[12:11] **Matt Breit**: Yeah.

[12:13] **Christy Gillham**: I think that's fair.

[12:15] **Mikyö Clark**: That's helpful.

[12:17] **Matt Breit**: Yeah. Can you guys hear me?

[12:19] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah.

[12:20] **Matt Breit**: Okay, cool. Oh, I'm sorry. I swapped. I was in the library, so I'm gonna place where I can talk now. I think the. So for context, the agency that we're looking at is BrightWeb. We have nonprofit experience, looks great, it feels like a great team vibe for us. They have a bunch of sort of sites under their belt. We feel like they could do a pretty decent job. The question that came up was, what room with you guys? Is that a better working relationship given everyone's background?

[12:50] **Matt Breit**: And there were some conversations around like the degree to which we could very confidently hand things like messaging off to you. Would it trust you to post on our behalf to generate guidelines to then action those guidelines without needing to hire like more copywriters and more like additional staff beyond just the sort of people who did the core thinking. So the main challenge here, right, is Kargara Retreats is a US-based nonprofit. We are filing our 1023 as far as I know this week.

[13:23] **Matt Breit**: We have a wholly owned subsidiary in Portugal, which is a for-profit Portuguese retreat center. Then we are running a capital campaign for which Tergar Retreats US needs to raise $3.5 million to help fund the construction of the Portuguese retreat center. And those are three distinct communications channels. In order for the capital campaign to be successful, the Tergar Retreats brand needs to have a sort of authentic and legitimate looking Web presence, digital presence, so that when funders or potential donors go to look at us, they're like, totally trust these guys have their shit together.

[14:00] **Matt Breit**: We can't only co-stumbling your reputation, nor do we necessarily want to. So we need them to see that we're legitimate, that we've got our house in order, our shit's together. I will in fact give you a million dollars. So there's the combination of we could really use some help developing the actual campaign collateral that Christy is going to use. To pitch major gifts. Those need to be polished AF, which we know and feel pretty confident you guys can do. Bright Web could also probably do that. That's an important thing.

[14:32] **Matt Breit**: But then there's this base level of brand identity and just basic digital presence. The website needs to look polished. It needs to get updated. It needs to be easy to update and move forward. Totally believe you guys could do the build so that we don't, anyone can go in and work on that. Our social media presence needs to have some kind of like baseline. It's just that sort of like core stuff so that all the other things can flow.

[14:56] **Matt Breit**: We can't take on the narrative journey of trying to explain to people what the hell a mandala is. Like that's just not, that's for the mandala to do. It's for the YoungA Foundation to figure out, like not our job. We can make gestures to it, but like people need to know, Tergar retreats, Hoppers retreats. They have a retreat center in Portugal. If you want to go there, you register with that center. Oh, and they're fundraising to build this really cool campus specifically for the three-year traditional intensive retreat.

[15:27] **Matt Breit**: But that's kind of like the, it's like trying to build three ships at once. Does that make sense? And so like we need the foundation, then we immediately need campaign collateral for fundraising, and then we need to like regroup where everyone is at because the MADI will have marketing needs to rent their facilities that are separate from Tergar Retreats, which needs to host and run retreat programs, which is sort of like, you know, another separate thing. Does that clarify? Totally.

[15:56] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah. Yeah. And I'm familiar with this kind of distinction.

[16:01] **Matt Breit**: I can't claim the Dharma organization problem.

[16:04] **Mikyö Clark**: Exactly. I can't claim that, you know, we've done a great job in my community per se, so I wouldn't give that as an example, but certainly like, Yeah, the kind of like, okay, this is a retreat center that has its own like business model that has to function, you know, both separate and distinct from and also like fully aligned with the kind of core sangha. And then there's like, right, yeah, the fundraising layer and the core brand. So I get that.

[16:33] **Mikyö Clark**: I mean, I, yeah, I guess what would help you, you know, vet us in our capacity. Yeah. Like, ask us some hard questions. Yeah. Like, obviously, like, we want to be in a culture of candor here. And so I think, you know, and, and honestly, like, if it's not the best fit, it's not the best fit. Like, we want to be real about that, too. So, like, let's just talk. Yeah.

[16:58] **Matt Breit**: It's a great question, Miky. And I, I appreciate it. And let's, let's do that. Let's do radical Candor. The, the conversation we had where we were like, we just got, we gotta come talk to them. Right. It's like, we were like, shit, man. Could we just, should we hire, could we do a piecemeal? Like we started, we got into the piecemeal conversation where it's like, Brightwebs dope. They're awesome. They're like a really cool team with 10 out of 10 recommend them. Like love the vibes, but we were like, too much for the website.

[17:23] **Matt Breit**: We don't need to spend that much money. It's like a, it's a basic Squarespace or basic WordPress build. It just needs to look nice. That's all that needs to do. Right. So we're like, okay. We were thinking about that to a team. And I was like, campaign collateral. Like it's a little pricey over there. You know, it's got a lot of nonprofit experience. We're like, ah, we could probably, Zach was like, Suede's a really solid designer. I think we could just give it to them.

[17:45] **Matt Breit**: And so then we're like, well, now two thirds of the scope, we're saying, let's just give it to Miky and Ian and Suede. Let's hop on a call and see if this is actually going to be a better fit. And then thinking long term, it was like, well, we told like, Miky, we know the work you've done with Ritual. There's a bunch that we were like, oh, long term, that could work really well. My hard question to you, Miky, and the team is, you said yourself, your community hasn't done this as well.

[18:12] **Matt Breit**: This seems like a weirdly hard nut to crack. My community went through this well. TMMC is an utter shit show when it comes to this. Tregar as a family is moving in the direction of becoming kind of a shit show for this. So how would you, knowing the problem space, right? And knowing the modes of failure of this problem space, for sure. How do you think you guys could help us make sure that our capital campaign is successful?

[18:43] **Matt Breit**: We get a good foundation rolling and we were set up for success for the next couple of years. That would be my, like, knowing that it's kind of difficult. Zak, go ahead.

[18:52] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah.

[18:56] **Zak**: Yeah, just, I mean, echoing that and naming too, there's like this really interesting spot of Miky, your background specifically is like the perfect background, which BrightWeb doesn't have a person on their team who has 25 years of living in community and operating it. And I want to specifically name, you know, we have one retreat center right now in Portugal, but we're already exploring the idea of like, is Tergar Retreats, a series of retreat centers around the globe that is much like you do with your community.

[19:28] **Zak**: How do we start thinking about also then using the Web3 space of like, what are DAOs and how are they different than sanghas and how are they different than the community we're building? So I just want to throw that piece in there too of like, well, we've all been in this space that's towed the line already and y'all are among the people who are thinking about it and have a practice.

[19:51] **Suede**: Let me take a stab at it.

[19:54] **Mikyö Clark**: Sure.

[19:55] **Suede**: You know, what you're getting with this team is a team of people, you're looking at them, that have decades of experience in this area, not only with the practice, but with brand narrative, building websites, and developing capital campaigns. And we're going to be doing the work. We're not going to be handing it off to junior level people.

[20:18] **Matt Breit**: Okay.

[20:19] **Suede**: And I think that, you know, working with a, with these spaces, this scrappy team is going to be hugely to your benefit. And that's just kind of the, the framework that I wanted to establish and, and I'll there. Yeah.

[20:39] **Mikyö Clark**: So, Matt, I'll, I'll try to answer. So basically, In my own context, there is one center that has done it well in my community that is more, I don't want to make it generational, I don't want to make it digital native, but that's more like not stuck in the past, that's more evolutionary. And so I do have a model that I think is successful for this kind of work. I think what's interesting is like, okay, you have kind of the karmic momentum of the larger Tergar organization and Sanga, right? That's one thing.

[21:35] **Mikyö Clark**: I think my question to you, Christy, earlier about, like, what is the difference with the terregar Retreats brand? You know, where I would really want to dig in is, like, how much of the terregar Retreats brand is trying to appeal to, like, net new people, whether that's net new owners or net new practitioners, is that its role? And, you know, how much of, like, what wants to be coalesced there in terms of brand and narrative DNA is kind of a departure from Tergar and like what's existed to date, yeah?

[22:15] **Mikyö Clark**: Zak's muted, but he wants to say something.

[22:20] **Zak**: I was waving away Suede. Christy, you should talk to this first, but I'll chime in after.

[22:25] **Christy Gillham**: Yeah, I mean, you're hitting on a really good point. So we are very much trying to develop a whole new audience and constituent base. Like we are starting from ground zero. We have a thousand contacts in our CRM system and that's it. So, I mean, we are really, yeah, just at this point of like, we need to figure out not only who our audiences are, but also really build it up. So, I mean, we need every range of donors we can imagine. We need to put butts in seats.

[22:51] **Christy Gillham**: So there's a range of people that we're trying to connect with all at once. And it's not like we have a good base to start from either.

[23:01] **Mikyö Clark**: Matty, do you guys want to go? I'll raise my hand too and be in the queue here.

[23:05] **Zak**: Yeah, but in addition to that, we also have, we're building a three-year retreat center and Rinpoche's got 10 million hits monthly or yearly that he hits. So we have this also huge base of people that are already practicing with him through Tergar International or online that need butts, in seats in retreats.

[23:26] **Mikyö Clark**: They need to convert. Yeah.

[23:28] **Zak**: Yeah. And so I, I do want to say, while, while we are definitely looking for donors to expand a new audience, like, we were just having a conversation with Kun Song, who's one of our, she's, she's deciding who gets to go into three-year retreat. And she's like, we just don't have enough opportunities for westerners to be in retreat to see if they would be a good fit. Like, we need them to do a month-long retreat to see if they can handle three years of retreat.

[23:51] **Matt Breit**: Right?

[23:51] **Mikyö Clark**: For sure.

[23:51] **Zak**: So. So I definitely want to say, yeah, we need to build new stuff, but we also have this huge audience of people that would be so excited to come from Americas and Europe and do more retreat. And we have run a couple over the last couple of years. And part of what we want to do this year is figure out, can we expand that? And it's also really silly because Turo retreats should be running retreats, right? So make sure we're actually doing that piece too.

[24:18] **Christy Gillham**: Yeah, thanks, Zak.

[24:24] **Matt Breit**: Second, seconded and thirded, but I'm going to do a thing I feel like I frequently do in terms of the POV that I hold. This is sort of part and parcel of the problem, like this conversation, right? Like we're already in like four different directions. We can't move any of those directions forward without a foundational work done on branding. We need that. We need to know something about tone, something about identity. We need to be slightly different from the rest of the Mandala without being like our own weird, wildly eccentric thing, right?

[24:59] **Matt Breit**: So we've got some wiggle room, but still need to feel comfortable and familiar to our existing, as yet untapped but existing audience. Then we need capital campaign collateral. Then we can think about so that Christy can sit down and have meetings with people. Then we can think about what if Terre Rouge retreats runs retreats that are 30 different like cool man, let's not relevant. We wouldn't even know what to say. We would have to do all the reach out to the centers. We would have to develop programs and then we would have to market them.

[25:33] **Matt Breit**: That's so far down the line relative to what we need to get funding in. This year so that we have money to continue the construction that is breaking ground like in T minus a couple of months. So like that is the North Star, like full stop. But to, and it's an excellent question and everyone's saying true things. I'm not trying to like disagree with anyone. It's just like it's really hard to stay focused.

[25:59] **Matt Breit**: Then for sure we have a preexisting audience of caregivers people They actually don't know how much they want to travel from the US to Portugal. We've made a number of assumptions about how excited people will be to come fly to Portugal, five hour time difference, hop a bus for two and a half hours or whatever, to get to the middle of nowhere with not great infrastructure to bridge, Coimbra to Figueira da Foz. There's a bunch of logistical things we need to figure out. For sure, Portuguese Tergar people, for sure, like Western Europe, yes.

[26:36] **Matt Breit**: We should almost certainly be the destination for all Tergar students in Western Europe with maybe some adjustments for like our Eastern European contingent. The UK might not want to cross over, right? But we know that we've got some interest there. And Tergar retreats needs to sort out like pretty seriously, is it going to be better for us to run retreats in the US at an affiliate center? Than ask people to spend the time and money and deal with the logistics of calendars to fly to Europe. So we should not assume that.

[27:09] **Matt Breit**: We have to test and push on that one a little bit. So there will be a bunch of marketing work later, but we can't do any of that until we have some sense of what the core brand is. We could sketch out those channels and those pipelines for sure, but the most critical one is We need a website that is accurate, looks nice, and easy to update. Then we need brand guidelines that we can use to develop that campaign collateral at a super high level.

[27:35] **Matt Breit**: So that Christy and Matt can very confidently pitch people on giving us a shitload of money to build the retreat center. The center of that retreat center narrative is that we are building a three-year retreat center. It'll be one of the only, as you know, one of the few in the Western world where people can come and do that form of retreat. Totally. That we need to build a pipeline from facilitator to leaders, from retreater, you know, from meditator to three year intensive retreat goes to that thing.

[28:03] **Matt Breit**: That'll be a future job that we'll have to work with other people in the mandala to do. That's not going to be this quarter, not going to be second quarter. So like that also can get put on the radar, but pushed. Does that make sense? But like, it's, there's so much to do here, but I just want to make sure that we're clear on what the ask of you is.

[28:20] **Matt Breit**: We ask is brand foundation campaign collateral and then like then then let's celebrate we and then let's think about all the other stuff that everybody just said.

[28:32] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, what I can say is like, the, the brand work itself is my, my work. Right. Like, that's where I would be leading the most. And, and it's a really exciting challenge. Right. Both the, the net new piece, which I kind of felt or gleaned or intuited from the RFP, which, you know, I mean, candidly, like, you two, Zak and Matt, are great examples of that in my life. You're like, hey, we're entering this path, right?

[29:22] **Mikyö Clark**: People like you, more people like you, and speaking our language is really exciting because I think it is different. I've seen in my own community this kind of generational influx and there's a.

[29:40] **Suede**: Very different.

[29:43] **Mikyö Clark**: Language and format and story there. I think what this path means to people is very different than, let's say, my parents' generation. So that's one piece. The second piece is we need to convert people from our sangha to do deep practice. This is also just personally an exciting challenge for me to try to communicate. I'm like, how do you get people to meditate more intensively who are already in the game? That sounds like a really fun challenge. Let's figure that out together. It seems like Retreats is the brand for that.

[30:30] **Mikyö Clark**: It's not like, go hang out with the master, which we all know the groupie model. We just go and hang out with the master all the time. Well, that's not going to get you there. Yeah. So how do we kind of like take a stand for that? And, you know, we have basically like infrastructure for that. That's, that's what we're saying. Yeah. Like there are places you can come for that specific purpose that are designed to be conducive. Yeah. Awesome. Like that's beautiful.

[31:00] **Mikyö Clark**: And then, yeah, like obviously on the fundraising side, I mean, I think probably Christy, whether you have this documented all the way or not, you have some personas or proto personas of the kinds of donors and the talking points that they need to hear. But I think we could drill into that, right? I think that there's also, you know, Everyone feels the depression and intensity of the times. We don't need to say Kali Yuga, right? But we can kind of like hit on that.

[31:41] **Mikyö Clark**: And like one of the few leverage points that we have, yeah, is like kind of like fields like these and people really going all the way. So yeah, for whatever that's worth, I think the brand work is actually you know, it's very exciting to me personally, and it's also where I think the potency of Retreats and the differentiation can really come in. And then, yeah, I feel totally confident that, like, Suede can embody that in a design, and we can, you know, bring that to life in collateral and all of that.

[32:14] **Mikyö Clark**: So, yeah, it's my please. Zak's still muted if he wants to talk.

[32:23] **Matt Breit**: Yeah.

[32:25] **Zak**: I'll actually go last in this group, so Matt or Christy, if either you want to go in.

[32:29] **Matt Breit**: Christy, go ahead.

[32:31] **Christy Gillham**: I was just going to share that we do, so we did do a persona breakdown when I first started, and that was at the very beginning. I feel like it could be updated and evolved. We do have a very rough, I shouldn't say rough, like we have an outline of a slide deck, a pitch deck for the capital campaign.

[32:47] **Christy Gillham**: We started very lightly working on the website, so there is some base to work with, but I guess my question was going to be, and Matt, you can chime in if we need to pause this question, but what would be like the workflow? Would you tackle brand narrative messaging first and simultaneously work on the website? Or I would just be curious how you would approach, you know, this first phase, knowing what it is we need to get done.

[33:14] **Mikyö Clark**: Does the Tergar folks want to speak or should I respond?

[33:19] **Matt Breit**: Go ahead and respond to that. Let's just come back and pin the sort of like net new as a topic.

[33:25] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, I would run a pretty thorough discovery. I don't know in the mandala sense if there are other stakeholders we want to talk to, but I would run a thorough brand discovery that's playful and fun and also precise at kind of extracting the essence. I would formulate a core kind of brand strategy and narrative before we go into design. I think it's important that, you know, and we can be like generating kind of visual motifs and metaphors and like an overall aesthetic through that process.

[34:03] **Mikyö Clark**: But I would start with articulating and really aligning around a brand strategy and then moving into design and expression.

[34:13] **Christy Gillham**: I just asked a quick follow-up question in terms of like discovery, what does that usually look like for you? I know you kind of touched on it lightly, like would you meet with our team individually as a group with Matt Breit, who has like all this base knowledge, or I'm curious how you usually approach that.

[34:29] **Mikyö Clark**: I, yeah, I like to do it double blind clinical style where I actually isolate you so you don't get to go into group think, but that we would, we would select that together in terms of who. Gets those one on ones and then we could also do like a kind of group session if we want. Probably like, you know, Matt Breit here has a brand strategist mind as well and can, you know, scaffold and chip in, I assume. And so like, yeah, but I would want to do like, I don't know.

[34:58] **Mikyö Clark**: I don't know how many stakeholders are at like this first radius, but, you know, in a startup context, this would be like the co-founders. Yeah. So whoever that kind of is in this context, I would say like max like three or three to five voices. But yeah, that's how I would start.

[35:19] **Christy Gillham**: Thank you for that. Appreciate that.

[35:25] **Matt Breit**: Zak, you wanna go?

[35:29] **Zak**: I'm just curious Miky, like how do you in your other, like in your other retreat centers, how do you guys handle donations and like fundraising there? Like what's, What's worked for you guys before?

[35:46] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, do a Gana Puja and have an auction with plenty of alcohol and no half joking.

[35:57] **Matt Breit**: That's what we used to do.

[35:59] **Mikyö Clark**: It depends on the context. I think.

[36:04] **Matt Breit**: In it.

[36:05] **Mikyö Clark**: Like, this is like infrastructure. Yeah. So that's, like, kind of categorically a little bit different, let's say. Yeah. And. So, yeah, with zomlingar, which is the one that I mentioned that's higher functioning, let's say, you know, this was like. Yeah, I mean, it's. It's actually similar because it was like. More European centric. So it was, like, geographically relevant, although it's, it truly is, like, International. And so there was, like, I don't know, there's a couple larger funders from Russia and I think, you know.

[36:47] **Zak**: It'S.

[36:47] **Mikyö Clark**: Hard for me to respond fully in the abstract without understanding a bit more of, like, the CRM and, like, where. Things are currently. But I think that, like, again, this is where we could bifurcate between existing and net new. Yeah. And kind of really look at those as distinct persona personas or audiences or even campaigns. Because if, if this is, if we're talking to people who have given us money for things like large chunks of money for things before, I think that's a very different conversation than people who have not.

[37:20] **Matt Breit**: Right.

[37:21] **Mikyö Clark**: So I don't know. It's a little bit abstract. I mean, I can speak to what I've seen work, but I think thinking about it as infrastructure and then thinking about the distinction between those who have given in the past and then people that were reaching out in that news may be a basic distinction.

[37:43] **Matt Breit**: Cool, Zak. Okay, cool. Yeah, I want to be careful that we not throw fundraising as a category around, there are multiple kinds and we're specifically engaged in a capital fundraising campaign. Large fundraising target, material built project at the end of it, which is very different than fundraising to build a stupa. Very different than fundraising to fund operations for the next year. Your annual pledge drive for NPR every 10 to 25, right?

[38:14] **Ian Boucher**: For sure.

[38:15] **Matt Breit**: Different entirely, right? So for me, the apples to apples is how much experience do you guys have supporting capital campaigns specifically would be, I think, the most useful way to drill into how you might do this. But I want to go back to this net new question, right? Which is like one of the problems that Tergar has is they currently, there's a little bit of donor fatigue because there is a mandala. And people get hit up multiple times for multiple kinds of projects.

[38:45] **Matt Breit**: And so there's, you know, a push, part of the push for the mandala to get its infrastructure organized is to try and stop doing that. Right. Because it, it's net negative for everybody. If the mandala loses donor engagement because they get hit up too much. So we want to be sensitive both to how much we tap into that Network, which I know Christy and Matthew were talking about and holding the POV on, but we, you know, She could speak to that, I'm sure. So we need to cultivate new ones.

[39:16] **Matt Breit**: And I think that there is a question broadly about like there's the push to get donations for the capital campaign, which is there's a sort of horse cart question, I think, about Carrigar retreats building its brand and marketing itself to Carrigar students. Obviously we have a pre-existing pool of people who might want to come on retreats. We're going to need more people than that. So there, like, which is a tergivers retreat marketing challenge to the extent that the capital campaign can support us building a list of people that we might then market retreats to.

[39:55] **Matt Breit**: That's cool. I think that's actually probably the order of operations. Certainly we'll be doing both a little bit simultaneously, but if I had And this is an open question to everyone else here. If you made me bet a million.

[40:11] **Mikyö Clark**: Dollars.

[40:13] **Matt Breit**: On one or the other, I would bet a million dollars that the best way to do it is to make the capital campaign a success and use that list and those efforts post-capital campaign to then try and market Tergar retreats versus trying to cultivate an audience for Tergar retreats. And then get those people to donate. I think the goal is conversion of potential donors first and foremost, because in my mind, selling you on getting interested in Tergar is one conversion point.

[40:45] **Matt Breit**: Then converting you to donating to a project that you may or may not be invested in is like a much bigger lift versus the opposite. So that's kind of how I've been thinking about like, We have net new needs across all channels. Maky will need new people outside of the teargard to rent their facility. We need new people to go on retreats. We need new people to donate. Donations are probably the most critical one.

[41:15] **Mikyö Clark**: I can speak to what I've seen work in Buddhist community context. And, and then I can speak to like my own experience, which is more, you know, whatever startup fundraising, let's say, in terms of like, but in the Buddhist context. So, which I referenced before, did like a, I don't know, it was like little under 2 million euro temple build. And that's probably the closest analog to what's happening here. And I was not in any way a like DRI on that. But I was a fly on the wall and kind of tracked the whole thing.

[41:56] **Mikyö Clark**: I would say the lion's share there.

[41:59] **Matt Breit**: Were.

[42:01] **Mikyö Clark**: Committed students who had been engaged long enough to have this kind of lifelong commitment, but were also saw the significance of this particular place. And like the vision there. So I would say like get a quote from Ian Boucher about the importance of the, you know, like we leading with those things, I think are incredibly powerful. Right.

[42:31] **Matt Breit**: Where it's like, we've got some already.

[42:33] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah. So that's, that's a really leveraged situation. I think like, I don't, again, I don't know how he holds kind of the positionality of the two centers in Portugal. But in our case, this was like the kind of crown jewel of the mandala, right? It's literally like the international guard that has a little, like little apartment buildings that represent all the other places. It's like the UN of the Suede community, you know? So people like really got that. They're like, oh, this is like an epicenter. Yeah.

[43:06] **Mikyö Clark**: So if there's any way we can like brand it as an epicenter, even if that's just an epicenter of deepness. Like, I think that is a really important view for people to hold and to say, like, you know, again, if we had to make a more cutting kind of distinction, it's like, yeah, like, you know, practice is where the rubber meets the road. Right.

[43:29] **Mikyö Clark**: And, like, all, all this training and all of this Buddhist philosophy and all this stuff eventually leads to, like, you coming here and doing the thing, and so this is where progress is made. And again, I'm being a lot more sharp than I would be in any public-facing materials, but I'm saying that to you all to make harder distinctions between the two. So, yeah, that's some quick thoughts.

[44:00] **Matt Breit**: Thanks, Miky. I want to be mindful of time. We've got 15 minutes left. Mm-.

[44:05] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Matt.

[44:10] **Ian Boucher**: That's exactly what I was gonna say, too. And just using this point to maybe talk about some 2 structural things that are in my mind is.

[44:21] **Mikyö Clark**: 1, the.

[44:24] **Ian Boucher**: Amount of bandwidth that the Jira team has for Weekly reviews and check ins as we go through this, like, are you guys envisioning a workflow in which we are doing standups every week? If we were to be the ones chosen for the full package. And then alternatively.

[44:45] **Matt Breit**: I think we're very.

[44:46] **Ian Boucher**: Comfortable with being plugged into specific work streams and then working with others just because of the nature of the freelancing work that we all do. And then I guess so the part 2 of that question is, is the.

[44:59] **Mikyö Clark**: Other group.

[45:01] **Ian Boucher**: Comfortable with that working arrangement as well, or are they more of a either it's all or nothing?

[45:06] **Mikyö Clark**: I have a.

[45:10] **Matt Breit**: Question. Second one I can answer for sure. We haven't talked about it with them. We just looked at their proposal and we're like, I wonder if we could, we should talk to these guys. Yeah, would need to pitch them on that if it ended up being a piecemeal thing. And then the first one, hard to say, Matthew's time is kind of at a premium, so I wouldn't expect him to be in weekly meetings, but someone like Christy and myself or Christy and Zak, some combination of us, I think, would be able to make that space.

[45:41] **Matt Breit**: I don't know what you guys think, but I would be pro I would be pro meeting frequently and canceling if we don't need it versus the alternative. That tends to be, I think, a good way to do it.

[45:57] **Christy Gillham**: I second that. All four meeting, as much as we need to, if that's once a week, and then if we need to change the cadence as things get into more of a flow, then that's great, but absolutely would be up for that and would probably most likely be at least a consistent in those weekly meetings.

[46:14] **Matt Breit**: Beautiful.

[46:14] **Mikyö Clark**: Nice.

[46:16] **Ian Boucher**: I think that just because of the predominance of this time being spent on the brand strategy, which obviously is the fundamental building block for this whole project, that was good time well spent. But I was wondering if there's anything outside of the brand direction that you guys wanted to ask specifically of Suede perhaps? For the website build or the design creation or if that's well understood?

[46:45] **Matt Breit**: I don't know about other people. I assume I don't remember what you guys put in your proposal. I'm sorry. WordPress backend. What would be your chosen or preferred?

[47:01] **Suede**: I have a document that I can forward after the meeting. That kind of lays out Squarespace versus WordPress. It boils down to like having your content free and available and able to take it with you versus being locked into Squarespace's system. Also, WordPress with this Enfold theme that I'm recommending is completely versatile. There's a lot more that you can do with it with regard to design and layout and that kind of thing.

[47:33] **Suede**: And then also the functionality is far greater when you're thinking about adding dynamic functionality or whatever, if you're going to integrate a CRM or a booking system, Squarespace doesn't really do that stuff. And then in full theme has a drag and drop editor, which I've found that 90% of people can get it really easily. You know, there's always that 10% that they're just like, they just, tech just doesn't work with their brain, right? So you gotta make sure you put somebody on it that's got a little bit, yeah, that fits in the 90%.

[48:12] **Suede**: So anyway, yeah, I'll drop that doc in the chat.

[48:16] **Matt Breit**: That'd be awesome. Actually, if you can email it just so we have that, that's not in the chat, that'd be great. We layer frame the agency we used to, that Doc and I used to work at, I used to run. We were 90% WordPress shop, also sometimes some other weird experimental stuff. So very familiar with it, very comfortable with it. If that's what you guys like to use, that's totally fine.

[48:35] **Suede**: And then real quick, I'll just say that I would recommend using WP Engine as your host.

[48:39] **Matt Breit**: For sure.

[48:40] **Mikyö Clark**: 100%.

[48:41] **Matt Breit**: No debate. Yep.

[48:43] **Mikyö Clark**: Yep.

[48:45] **Matt Breit**: Awesome. Great. In terms of design, we can have conversations about that if we decide to move It'll be an organic conversation. I don't know what I would even ask at this stage about that. There's an existing design sensibility. There's been a single freelancer that's been helping the whole mandala do design. So there is a fair amount of consistency across organizations. Our current brand system is a little overly complicated, can get simplified, can get refined. You're not starting from scratch. We don't need to reinvent the wheel here.

[49:23] **Matt Breit**: So we're sort of ahead of the game on that front. So you would have a pretty solid starting point. And I want to be clear, we're not interested, I think, in going back and sort of re-adjudicating a lot of that. So we could use that as a starting point for the branding conversation. But do not want to go all the way back to the beginning in terms of logo design and da-da-da-da-da-da.

[49:44] **Matt Breit**: I think just refinement on what there is what's needed in the short term to make sure that we're buttoned up enough to be asking people for money. I think I do want to ask slash get some quick thoughts on the very little competitive research has been done at this stage. It's not critically relevant at this point because it's really a Samadi problem. But there is going to be some of that.

[50:16] **Matt Breit**: We do need to stand out in this space in a world where like wellness and meditation is going to be like, I don't know, a multi-billion dollar industry. I'm pretty sure I thought that like the projected cags for 2026 in Europe is like a growth of like 20 or 30% or something. It's crazy. So like it's, it is a crowded space. So that net new thing, I just like the thing that gives me the most anxiety.

[50:43] **Matt Breit**: When I think about this project and what we need to do is like being distinctive while still being Tergar, we don't want to alienate our existing audience. We need to grow our audience and we simultaneously need to not be in, like we need to not be cannibalizing like Tergar International, Tergar Institute. So there's some like, there's some nuance there that I feel like Miky, you'll appreciate, you know, in terms of like, organizations that don't play well together and have some non-trivial overlap in a Venn diagram.

[51:17] **Matt Breit**: So I think that's one of the core strategic challenges here for a partner that comes on board is helping us think through how we're going to, how we're going to do that in a graceful way. And I think some, some research and some competitive analysis might be useful. Yeah. Yeah.

[51:33] **Mikyö Clark**: I love that stuff personally, just like sense making and you know, obviously I have a lot of that intrinsically given my background, but does that also mean like appealing to people who would want to rent the center for their own retreat? Is that a part of what you're saying?

[51:53] **Matt Breit**: That is a thing that Samadhi will have to do. They don't yet have facilities to do that with. So we're off the hook for probably 2026. In terms of really needing to worry about that much. There are going to be some facilities built this winter that we can rent to people that are separate from the three year retreat. But it's going to be like campsites, maybe some glamp sites. It's like tests. So we'll be testing. So there'll be an opportunity to test the messaging later in the year, maybe. That's really a 2027 problem.

[52:24] **Matt Breit**: I'm just thinking in terms of like, you know, we're going to set up some Matthews and will work to file coin with Zak. We've got some access to some tech people there. You guys would have access to tech people. We think that's a very strong possible audience for this kind of project, especially because we have a lot of science connections. Some of the foremost neuroscience researchers on meditation are in our network, and we'll be running some trial stuff. So we can make a tech play and a science play.

[52:58] **Matt Breit**: If we want to, which opens up some new audiences that might want to fund it just for the science of it, you know? And, and so there's, yeah, so there's some, there's some potentials there, too. So I'm, I'm that, that's a way we're, like, we're really not in competition with any of, of our sister orgs.

[53:14] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

[53:16] **Matt Breit**: So just thinking about that spectrum of, like, when do we start stepping on toes and sort of.

[53:24] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, yeah, that's super cool. Did you read the paper that Dan Brown and John authored with a couple other authors?

[53:33] **Matt Breit**: We have not read it.

[53:35] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, so that's a cool one, right? It's like, has there been any work done on three year retreat? That's the only paper that I'm personally aware of that's like, okay, here's how the brain looks through these different stages of mahamudra.

[53:50] **Matt Breit**: Right.

[53:50] **Mikyö Clark**: If you can be like, that's the kind of thing we do here in Portugal. Like that's a great, it's like this ain't mindfulness. Like, you know, that's awesome. But right.

[54:00] **Matt Breit**: That's very much in our general cases, the poor and part of the brand narrative, like broadly, is that like, yeah, Peregrine, you're already in grade. Also science.

[54:12] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[54:13] **Matt Breit**: So John and Dan's favorite brand for Minguarimpeche, right? Like Minguarimpeche was one of the people who did that. So like, that's, It's in the Tergar brand. It's just no one has really like leveraged it. We're totally gonna, we're totally gonna take that part of the pie.

[54:24] **Mikyö Clark**: That's cool. That's actually really cool from a brand standpoint. I like it. Yeah. Nice. Lots, lots of possible there for sure.

[54:32] **Matt Breit**: Cool.

[54:34] **Mikyö Clark**: Nice.

[54:36] **Christy Gillham**: I am curious in terms of, timeline timeframe, if we were wanting to move forward, is like kicking things off in February realistic for your team or.

[54:47] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, it's funny. I'm actually, I don't, well, I actually don't know where everybody is, so maybe you're not all in Portugal, but I will be close to there, so I could, I could stop by. But yeah, we can start on Monday. We're ready to go.

[55:04] **Zak**: I actually want to follow up on that. You know, some of your timelines compared to other ones that we got were, they're aggressive. Not to say you couldn't do it, but I would love if, Maybe after this, one of the first things we do if we want to work together is like reevaluating what's actually realistic. And Ian, you asked about this, like what kind of feedback can you expect to get from us and what timeline?

[55:26] **Zak**: And I think me and Christy can be really responsive, but I think when we need to go to the larger org, that's one of the issues of like really slowing down.

[55:34] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

[55:36] **Ian Boucher**: For sure.

[55:37] **Zak**: But just definitely naming too, like I'd love for you guys to take another peek at your timelines. Knowing that we're not going to make a decision for probably another week, right, till next week, what changes on your end? And I'd also just to ask the three of you, if we were to decide to piecemeal this too, are you guys open to a different scope of work than we bid on, or is this all or nothing? How do you guys feel about that?

[56:03] **Mikyö Clark**: We didn't talk about it so much, so I'll let you guys answer.

[56:09] **Ian Boucher**: Yeah, I think we're, I don't want to speak for you guys either. We can just go around the horn. I think that's easy for us to do or easy for myself to do is coordinating with you guys doing the actual work. I don't know, Suede, do you feel like you could work with an outside team?

[56:29] **Suede**: Yeah, absolutely. I'd be curious who you know, who's, what the roles are, that kind of thing. I will say that, you know. Yeah, I prefer to work with this team.

[56:45] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, I think for me, like, obviously, you know, whatever the lion share of this call has been on brand strategy, like, if that's not a part of it, I don't think I'm as useful, candidly. Like, it's like, oh, I'm doing some PR strategy with AI and. Like my Buddhist background, like, here you go, you know, so, like, you know, I could help, but I don't, if it's more just like, hey, we want you guys to do the website.

[57:10] **Mikyö Clark**: And I think, like, I could advise and Suede can ship that, and it's gonna be great, you know, so I'm happy, but I'm happy to advise, like, if that's what it comes down to. So, yeah, I think the, the brand work is the essence to me, and, and it's also where, you know, I feel like I can add, like, differentiated value. So.

[57:32] **Matt Breit**: I just want to follow up with that. You made a really good point. I would assume an account for five rounds of review where the first couple are with the small team, and then we would take those to someone like Matthew Zimbal and any other executives that we might want to have feedback. So I would plan on like small team reviews. To get things to a point where we're ready to try and sell it to sort of leadership and that we might expect some feedback from leadership.

[58:01] **Matt Breit**: So I would add like another round or two, assuming that that's kind of going to be the way that we try to manage.

[58:08] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah. And what I'll say to your point, Zak, is just like, honestly, like, I don't really care about the time. Like, basically, like, if, like, if the latency is on the Targare side, like, I'm here and we'll deliver quickly and we will, right? And it's a milestone based situation. And if it's like, hey, it actually takes us whatever way longer, that's fine and we get paid when it's done. And for me, that's fine. It's just more like, let's do it, right? And get the alignment, which I know is challenging in an inter-organizational Mondalik matrix, right?

[58:45] **Mikyö Clark**: So yes. But that's so I don't know if it makes that much sense to try to project exact dates, like if it's helpful for you guys or if you have constraints that are really important, we can always work back from those. But if it's also like, hey, the latency is really on the larger Tergar side, we're fine with that.

[59:07] **Ian Boucher**: Yeah, I think just tacking onto that, knowing that there's these five rounds, maybe being able to work that into the timeline reeval that Zak has asked for. Maybe we can give you a better sense of what that would do to impact our timeline. Hopefully that'll help alongside of what Miky is saying. We're going to be dedicated working on this project with our full attention.

[59:32] **Matt Breit**: Great. The timelines are helpful for us to keep us honest.

[59:37] **Mikyö Clark**: Yeah, totally. So we can be an accountability for you as well.

[59:41] **Matt Breit**: That would be very helpful. Yes, please. Accountability for us, man. Um, guys, it's 301. Are there, is there anything else we need to wrap us?

[59:51] **Mikyö Clark**: Seems good. Yeah. I mean, if you want to, if there's anything that comes up that you want to ask us, you know, offline or email or telegram is fine. We can just go back and forth that way. And yeah, it's been good. Good to meet you, Christy.

[1:00:04] **Christy Gillham**: This is exciting. You all as well, really appreciate your time, your insight, your knowledge and excited at the potential.

[1:00:10] **Mikyö Clark**: Awesome, likewise for sure.

[1:00:12] **Christy Gillham**: Very insightful.

[1:00:14] **Ian Boucher**: Yeah, thanks everybody.

[1:00:16] **Matt Breit**: Been a pleasure.
