# Jan 27 Tergar Interview - Full Summary

#### Overview

* Tergar Retreats aims to raise **$3.5 million** in **3-5 years** for their capital campaign to build a three-year retreat center in Portugal
* Top **3** priorities for first phase: brand narrative and messaging framework, website build, and capital campaign collateral
* Organization is starting from ground zero with only **1,000** contacts in CRM and needs to build both donor base and practitioner audience
* Tergar Retreats needs to differentiate as the "practice brand" within the larger Tergar Mandala while avoiding donor fatigue and not cannibalizing sister organizations
* Team will make final agency decision by next week between this team and BrightWeb
* Mikyo's proposed approach: thorough brand discovery with individual stakeholder interviews, then strategy development, then design execution
* Both sides are open to piecemeal engagement, though Mikyo emphasized brand strategy is where he adds most differentiated value

#### Team introductions and backgrounds

* Zak is working producer-side for Tergar Retreats, supporting Christy and helping solve organizational problems
* Christy joined Tergar Retreats **8 months** ago as head of development and fundraising
* Matt holds finance and HR roles but is supporting marketing agency assessment due to his background running a successful agency in New York
* Ian has worked with Reggio Group for **5 years** doing project and account management for their freelancer guild
* Mikyo has marketing and storytelling background across crypto and other sectors, is a second-generation Dzogchen practitioner, and has tracked Mingyur Rinpoche's work for years through family connections
* Suede is a production artist, UX/UI designer, and graphic designer living in Colorado's Arkansas River Valley with decades of internet design experience

#### Project scope and priorities

* Christy identified brand narrative messaging, website build, and capital campaign collateral as the top **3** areas for initial collaboration
* Matt emphasized need to stay focused on immediate priorities: brand foundation and campaign collateral for major gift pitching
* Team has **7** projects bundled under one RFP and is exploring whether to work with one agency for everything or piecemeal the work
* Tergar Retreats is filing their 1023 nonprofit application this week
* Organization operates a wholly owned for-profit subsidiary in Portugal that runs the retreat center
* Construction on Portuguese retreat center is breaking ground in a couple months

#### Tergar Retreats brand positioning within the mandala

* Tergar Retreats is one organization within the "Tergar Mandala" of organizations all led under Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche's guidance
* Organization's focus is practice and retreat, positioning it as the "practice brand" within the mandala
* Christy noted the Tergar name is well known but Tergar Retreats specifically isn't, creating need to build distinct credibility
* Matt described the challenge as being slightly different from the rest of the mandala without being wildly eccentric
* Organization needs to feel comfortable and familiar to existing Tergar audience while appealing to new audiences

#### Current organizational state and audience needs

* Tergar Retreats has **1,000** contacts in CRM and is starting from ground zero on audience development
* Organization has some messaging on current website and video assets but lacks cohesive brand narrative guidelines or messaging framework
* Matthew Zimwalt (executive director) serves as the knowledge base and voice but content hasn't been systematized for consistent use
* Team needs to define mission, identity, and voice before building out website, outreach, marketing, and campaign materials
* Organization faces donor fatigue issue across the mandala because people get hit up multiple times for different projects
* Mingyur Rinpoche gets **10 million** hits monthly or yearly, representing huge base of existing practitioners who could convert to retreat attendance

#### Capital campaign goals and timeline

* Campaign goal is **$3.5 million** to fund construction of Portuguese retreat center
* Timeline is **3-5 years maximum** to raise the full amount
* Currently in quiet phase of campaign and need infrastructure built before public launch
* Campaign collateral needs to be polished enough for Christy and Matt to confidently pitch major gifts
* Donors need to see legitimate, professional web presence showing the organization has their operations together
* Team has rough outline of pitch deck but needs refinement
* Christy has done persona breakdown that could be updated and evolved

#### Brand strategy and discovery approach

* Mikyo proposed running thorough brand discovery before moving into design work
* Discovery would use "double blind clinical style" with isolated one-on-one interviews to avoid groupthink
* Would interview **3-5** key stakeholders (equivalent to co-founders in startup context)
* Could also include group session with team after individual interviews
* Process would be: discovery > core brand strategy and narrative > visual design and expression
* Visual motifs and aesthetic exploration could happen during discovery but formal design comes after strategy alignment
* Existing design system from mandala freelancer provides starting point - not reinventing from scratch
* Matt emphasized not interested in re-adjudicating logo and foundational elements, just refinement for fundraising readiness

#### Donor acquisition and conversion strategy

* Organization needs to cultivate entirely new donor base beyond existing Tergar network
* Matt argued conversion priority should be: attract potential donors first, then convert to donations, rather than building retreat audience first and asking them to donate
* Successful capital campaign list can then be used post-campaign to market retreats
* Mikyo referenced successful **under 2 million euro** temple build in his Buddhist community where lion's share came from committed long-term students who saw significance of the vision
* Leading with testimonials from committed practitioners like Ian Boucher about importance of the center could be powerful
* Team has access to tech audience through Matthew's Filecoin connections and neuroscience researchers studying meditation

#### Competitive positioning and differentiation challenge

* Matt identified core strategic challenge: being distinctive in crowded wellness/meditation space while remaining authentically Tergar
* Projected growth for meditation/wellness industry in Europe for **2026** is **20-30%**
* Need to avoid cannibalizing Tergar International and Tergar Institute while growing new audience
* Potential differentiation: science angle through neuroscience research connections (Dan Brown and John's paper on three-year retreat brain changes)
* Matt emphasized this is "not mindfulness" - can position as deeper, more intensive practice backed by science
* Tech and science audiences represent strong potential that wouldn't compete with sister organizations
* Some competitive research needed but not critically relevant yet since it's primarily a Samadhi (Portuguese center) problem for **2027**

#### Website technical approach and hosting

* Suede recommended WordPress with Enfold theme over Squarespace
* WordPress advantages: content portability, greater design versatility, superior functionality for CRM and booking system integration
* Enfold theme has drag-and-drop editor that **90%** of people can use easily
* Team unanimously agreed on WP Engine for hosting
* Matt confirmed comfort with WordPress from running **90%** WordPress shop at his former agency
* Some light website work has already started but needs brand foundation first
* Website needs to look polished, be accurate, and be easy for anyone to update

#### Project workflow and review process

* Team proposed weekly meetings with option to cancel if not needed rather than meeting less frequently
* Christy and Matt/Zak would consistently attend weekly check-ins (Matthew Zimwalt's time is at premium)
* Matt recommended planning for **5** rounds of review: initial rounds with small team, then presentation to leadership like Matthew Zimwalt for feedback
* Mikyo emphasized team can deliver quickly and is comfortable with latency being on Tergar side for organizational alignment
* Payment would be milestone-based
* Ian confirmed team would work with full attention and dedication on the project

#### Timeline expectations and flexibility

* Christy asked if February kickoff is realistic - Mikyo confirmed team is ready to start immediately
* Zak noted agency's timelines are aggressive compared to other proposals and requested reevaluation of what's realistic
* Zak and Christy can be responsive but larger org reviews create slowdowns
* Mikyo stated he doesn't care about exact timeline if latency is on Tergar side - prefers to focus on doing it right and getting alignment
* Team agreed to rework timeline accounting for **5** review rounds to give Tergar better sense of realistic schedule
* Tergar will make final decision next week

#### Scope flexibility and piecemeal options

* Zak asked if team is open to different scope than original bid or if it's all-or-nothing
* Suede expressed preference to work with this team but is open to working with outside team
* Mikyo stated brand strategy work is where he adds most differentiated value - less useful if that's not included
* Mikyo offered to advise if scope is reduced to just website, with Suede shipping the build
* Ian confirmed team is comfortable being plugged into specific workstreams and working with others due to freelancing nature
* Tergar hasn't discussed piecemeal approach with BrightWeb yet but would need to pitch them on it
* Both sides agreed to stay in touch via email or Telegram for any follow-up questions
