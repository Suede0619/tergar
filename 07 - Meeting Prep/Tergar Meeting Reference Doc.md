---

## The One Thing to Remember

They already chose us as a finalist. This meeting is about **trust and fit**, not convincing them we're qualified. Be present, be genuine, listen deeply.

---

## Opening: Set the Tone (First 5 Minutes)

- Thank them for the opportunity and for the thoughtful RFP
- Brief personal introductions -- keep it warm, not corporate
- Each person: one sentence on who you are, one sentence on why this project matters to you personally
- **Suede:** You might mention your time in Tibetan Buddhist communities in India/Nepal, your retreat center experience, and what drew you to this project specifically
- Signal that we want to hear from them first: *"We'd love to start by hearing from you -- what does success look like for this project from your perspective?"*

## Questions to Ask Tergar

### Understanding Their Priorities

1. **"What does success look like for you at the end of Phase 1 in March?"**
   Why: Shows we're outcomes-focused. Reveals what they actually care about most.

2. **"What's working well in your current donor outreach, and where do you feel the biggest gap?"**
   Why: We want to build on what works, not start from scratch. Shows respect for what they've already done.

3. **"How does the Tergar community currently engage with the retreat center vision? Is there existing energy and awareness, or is this a new conversation for most people?"**
   Why: Helps us gauge how much narrative building is needed vs. channeling existing momentum.

4. **"Are there specific foundations or grant opportunities you're already targeting for March?"**
   Why: Practical -- we need to know this to hit the ground running. Shows we take the timeline seriously.

### Understanding Their Organization

5. **"Who on your team will we be working with day-to-day, and what does their bandwidth look like?"**
   Why: We promised to reduce strain. We need to understand their capacity to calibrate our approach.

6. **"What's your comfort level with the current Tergar brand? Are we refreshing, evolving, or building something new for the retreat center?"**
   Why: Critical scoping question. The answer shapes the entire design and messaging approach.

7. **"How does Mingyur Rinpoche's involvement factor in? Are there approvals, content, or access we should plan around?"**
   Why: Understanding the teacher's role in the process is essential for a dharma organization.

### Understanding Their Concerns

8. **"What would make you nervous about working with an outside team on this?"**
   Why: Surfaces objections we can address directly. Shows we're not afraid of honest conversation.

9. **"Have you worked with an agency or external team before? What went well, and what would you want to be different this time?"**
   Why: Lets us position ourselves against their past experience, not just the other finalist.

10. **"Is there anything in our proposal that raised questions or that you'd like us to clarify?"**
    Why: Direct, confident. Gets any concerns on the table.

## Key Points to Make (Naturally, Not as a Script)

Work these into the conversation when the moment is right:

- **We're practitioners first.** This isn't a marketing project to us. Mikyo was born into the Nyingma/Kagyu lineage. Suede has decades of contemplative practice, lived in Tibetan Buddhist communities, and has direct retreat center experience. This work is personal.

- **The people in this meeting are the people doing the work.** No bait-and-switch. No handoff to junior staff. What you see is what you get.

- **We've done remarkably similar work.** Capital campaign materials for a retreat center. Community building from zero to hundreds of thousands. Full-cycle website design and development. This isn't theoretical for us.

- **We reduce your workload, not add to it.** Training, templates, documentation, systems. We want you to be self-sufficient when we're done, not dependent.

- **We move fast and communicate clearly.** Sasquatch keeps the trains running. Regular check-ins, milestone-based delivery, 24-48 hour response times.

## Things NOT to Do

- Don't trash the other finalist or speculate about who they are
- Don't get into granular tactical details (specific WordPress plugins, exact social media posting schedules, etc.) -- that's post-contract work
- Don't over-promise on timeline if they push for faster delivery -- be honest about what's realistic
- Don't lecture them about their own tradition or organization
- Don't use too much web3/crypto jargon -- translate everything into their world
- Don't fill silence -- if they're thinking, let them think

---

## If They Ask About Price

- Our proposal is $79K for the full year ($25K Phase 1, $54K Phase 2)
- We're confident in the value, but open to discussing scope adjustments if budget is a concern
- Phase 1 is milestone-based payment -- they're never paying ahead of delivered work
- Phase 2 retainer allows flexibility -- hours roll over, intensity flexes with campaign phases
- Frame it as: "We've structured this so you're paying for outcomes, not hours"

---

## If They Ask About the Web3/Crypto Background

- Reframe: "Web3 is the most competitive attention environment on the internet. Every project is competing for community, trust, and engagement with no established brand. We built communities from zero in that space."
- The skills transfer directly: storytelling, community architecture, trust-based engagement, viral growth
- We also bring traditional skills: WordPress, Figma, content strategy, PR, grant writing
- The web3 background is a bonus, not the whole picture

---

## Closing the Meeting Well (Last 5-10 Minutes)

- **Ask about their timeline:** "When are you hoping to make a decision?"
- **Ask about next steps:** "Is there anything else you'd like to see from us?"
- **Offer something concrete:** "We're ready to start immediately. If selected, we can have a kickoff workshop on the calendar within a week."
- **End with sincerity:** Express genuine gratitude for the conversation and genuine enthusiasm for the work. Not hype -- heart.

## Quick Reference: Their Evaluation Criteria (from the RFP)

1. Alignment with mission and values
2. Strength of strategic thinking
3. Quality of past work
4. Clarity of process
