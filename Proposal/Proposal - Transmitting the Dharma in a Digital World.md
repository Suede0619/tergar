# Transmitting the Dharma in a Digital World

A proposal to build Tergar’s digital presence for the next generation of practitioners, donors, and seekers worldwide. Where legacy and lineage become one.

---

## Context

The landscape of dharma is changing. From the pioneering and provocative era of [Swans Coming to the Lake](https://www.amazon.com/How-Swans-Came-Lake-Narrative/dp/0877736316) to [today’s conversation about Artificial Intelligence and the nature of mind](https://www.mindandlife.org/event/2025-mind-life-dialogue-xxxix/), the transmission of the Dharma in the modern era continues to evolve to meet the times. As our world continues to deepen into [the age of attention extraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XR0byERZY&t=18s)[,](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/96e3a739-dc8d-45f1-87d7-ec70a368371d) the mind training provided by authentic teachers offers an invaluable remedy for distraction and a path to unshakable sanity.

Tergar is uniquely positioned in this changing landscape, offering both a secular path and an esoteric, comprehensive vehicle at the intersection of Mahamudra and Dzogchen. Establishing a new place-based retreat center provides a foundation for expanding the Tergar sangha and maturing practice among existing members and teachers.

This effort requires a fresh face and a compelling narrative to recruit new allies, donors, and members who will breathe life into the retreat center, its community, and its lineage. That’s where we come in.

## North Star

### **Phase 1 (Jan-March): We’ve succeeded if…**

  ✧ Website is live, beautiful, and donor-ready by Feb 28

  ✧ Capital campaign collateral is complete and grant-ready by March 15

  ✧ The Tergar team can confidently use materials in donor meetings

  ✧ 3-5 grant applications submitted using our materials by March 31

  ✧ Foundation is laid for marketing & PR (strategy, templates, systems)

  ✧ Tergar team feels supported, not strained

### **Phase 2 (April-Dec): We’ve succeeded if…**

  ✧ Public launch is well-executed with clear messaging and visibility

  ✧ Website traffic and email list grow steadily (2-3x baseline)

  ✧ 50-100 retreat inquiries received

  ✧ 3-5 press placements secured

  ✧ Foundation is laid for the next 1,000 True Fans / 10 Major Donors

  ✧ Tergar has systems and templates to continue momentum independently

## Our Unique Approach

Traditional non-profit marketing will fail Tergar in its efforts to become more relevant and appealing to a broader range of contributors and contemplatives.

**We are not your garden-variety digital agency. We’re a different breed.** Practitioners building viral communities. Contemplatives who understand algorithms. Drawing on years of experience at the bleeding edges of digital currency, community-led marketing, and self-organizing teams. We’ve cut our teeth in the highly competitive, attention-scarce environments of emerging technology and are now committed to the deeper work of moving humanity forward. You need a team that understands both worlds. We are that team.

### [RaidGuild](https://www.raidguild.org/)

A decentralized collective of designers, developers, and strategists who have chosen to work together in a fundamentally different way. Rather than operating as a traditional agency, we function as a cooperative in which members self-organize around shared values of mutual support, transparent collaboration, and collective growth.

## What We’re Offering

### A Different Way of Working

We will become embedded members of your team, not an arm’s-length agency with too many slides and meetings. Our job is to reduce strain on the Tergar core team:

- Training delivered: Tergar team can update website independently (measured by post-launch edits made without our help)
- Templates & systems: Reusable assets that reduce future workload
- Clear documentation: All processes documented for future reference
- Responsive support: 24 to 48-hour response time maintained throughout the project

### Strategy Fluency + Creative Capacity

Most agencies are either strategic thinkers who outsource execution or creative doers who lack strategic depth. We’re both. Strategy and execution inform each other in real-time, eliminating the translation loss that kills most campaigns. 

We bring:

1. Brand positioning & narrative architecture (built category-defining brands in web3)
2. Community building at scale (grown communities from zero to millions)
3. Capital campaign strategy (donor psychology, cultivation cycles, foundation-grade materials)
4. Full-stack web development (WordPress expertise, custom integrations, 30+ sites)
5. UX/UI design (multi-stakeholder platforms, high-trust interfaces, contemplative aesthetics)
6. Content creation (copywriting, social media, visual storytelling)

### Domain-Specific Experience

We bring three layers of expertise that no traditional agency can match:

**Tibetan Buddhist Lineage:** Mikyö’s life is situated within the Tibetan lineage. Suede has decades across multiple traditions, months of immersion in India and Nepal, and experience in retreat center operations.

**Retreat Center & Capital Campaigns:** Suede designed capital campaign materials for a retreat center project, managed operations at a retreat center in Guatemala, and collaborated with Dr. Robinson on “The Heart Illuminated.”

**Web3 Community Building:** Mikyö built EigenLayer’s community from zero (6M token airdrop, ambassador program, 150K+ Discord). RaidGuild has shipped $367M+ in infrastructure and built foundational DAO tooling.

## Examples of Our Work

### Ritual - Brand and Community Growth

Grew a highly technical project brand:

1. Foundation [X account](https://x.com/ritualfnd) from 0 to 40k followers
2. [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ritual-net) from 35k to more than 100k community members
3. Led [website redesign](https://ritual-foundation-website-frontend.vercel.app/) (not yet launched, please keep link private)

### RaidGuild - Website UI Design & Development

Full-cycle project: Figma design, site development, and design system publication.

[Figma Designs](https://www.figma.com/design/i12YX9sbqeBXFJvExzA5PM/Raid-Guild-%7C-FINAL-%7C-Brand-%7C-Website-%7C-Archive-%7C-Q4-2025?node-id=4905-15213&p=f) | [Website](https://raidguild.org) | [Design System](https://www.brand.raidguild.org/)

### EigenLayer - Brand Storytelling

During his time at EigenLayer, Mikyö produced and co-directed a microdocumentary that distilled the project's story and impact. A lot of brand strategy work was completed upstream, but the film itself expresses that work in a compressed way:
