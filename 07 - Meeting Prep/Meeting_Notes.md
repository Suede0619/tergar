# Todays Meeting

### Project Overview & Team Introductions

- Tergar Retreats capital campaign meeting with potential marketing agency partners
- Client team:
  - Christy: Head of fundraising/development (8 months with org)
  - Matt: Finance/HR, former agency owner providing marketing assessment
  - Zach: Producer role, working with Turgor retreats
- Agency team (Radio Group):
  - Mikio: Marketing/storytelling, dharma practitioner background
  - Suede: UX/UI designer, production artist (Colorado mountains)
  - Ian: Project management, account management

### Capital Campaign Goals & Timeline

- Target: $3.5M over 3-5 years maximum
- Currently in quiet phase before public launch
- Portuguese retreat center construction breaking ground in coming months
- Three distinct communication channels needed:
  1. Tergar Retreats US (501c3 filing this week)
  2. Portuguese for-profit subsidiary retreat center
  3. Capital campaign materials

### Core Project Requirements

- Primary focus: Brand foundation before campaign launch
- Critical deliverables in order of priority:
  1. Brand narrative/messaging framework - currently at ground level
  2. Professional website build - needs to look polished for donor credibility
  3. Capital campaign collateral for major gift pitches
- Secondary considerations: Social media presence, marketing infrastructure

### Brand Strategy & Positioning Challenges

- Tergar Retreats vs broader Tergar mandala differentiation needed
  - Known brand but Tergar Retreats specifically isn't established
  - Must cut through mandala organization confusion
  - Position as "practice brand" focused on meditation/retreat
- Target audiences:
  1. Existing Tergar community (10M+ yearly interactions with Rinpoche)
  2. Net new donors and practitioners
  3. Western Europe retreat participants
- Donor fatigue concern across mandala organizations
- Competitive landscape: Crowded wellness/meditation market (20-30% projected growth 2026 Europe)

### Technical & Workflow Considerations

- WordPress preferred over Squarespace for flexibility/content ownership
- WP Engine hosting recommended
- Weekly check-ins proposed with Christy/Zach (Matthew's time limited)
- 5-round review process: small team → leadership feedback → iterations
- Piecemeal work arrangement possible with other agencies

### Next Steps & Decision Timeline

- Decision expected within one week
- Team open to revised timelines and scope adjustments
- Agency comfortable with milestone-based delivery regardless of client-side delays
- Follow-up discussions on specific workflow and partnership structure
