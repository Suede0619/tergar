# Design Brief - Tergar Retreats
**Distilled from Mikyo's strategy analysis. Focus: visual design, UX, brand, and collateral.**

---

## Brand Identity - Design Translations

| Characteristic | Design Translation |
|---|---|
| Authentic & Modern | Tibetan aesthetic + clean contemporary design |
| Science-Informed | Infographics, data viz, research-backed visual language |
| Accessible & Inclusive | Clear type, intuitive nav, WCAG compliance |
| Teacher-Led | Rinpoche featured prominently but warmly |
| Community-Oriented | Diversity, togetherness, connection |
| Global & Scalable | Works across cultures/languages, mobile-first |

## Dual-Path Visual Strategy

**Joy of Living (Secular):** Clean, modern, approachable. Nature imagery, light palette, minimal Buddhist iconography.

**Path of Liberation (Traditional):** Richer colors (golds, deep reds). Tibetan art elements, ceremonial visual language, lineage imagery.

**Challenge:** Cohesive brand system that flexes between both without feeling split.

---

## Competitive Design Lessons

- **Tara Mandala:** Strong visual identity tied to positioning. Tergar's science+tradition must be immediately visible.
- **Kagyu Samye Ling:** Authentic but dated. Elevate beyond "rustic monastery" to "contemporary sanctuary."
- **Shambhala:** Polish signals organizational competence.
- **Insight Meditation Society:** Simplicity conveys depth. Don't over-design.
- **Plum Village:** Warmth and gentleness while maintaining sophistication.
- **Goenka Vipassana:** Avoid anything "salesy."
- **1440 Multiversity:** High-end hospitality aesthetic. Tergar needs "corporate-grade" for donors, "authentic sanctuary" for retreatants.

## Target Audience Design Needs

**Major Donor (45-65):** Professional, polished, "investment-grade." Clean layouts, whitespace, data viz. Think foundation annual reports.

**Grant Officer (35-55):** Organized, scannable, evidence-based. Substance over style. March 2026 deadline is critical.

**Seeking Millennial/Gen Z (22-42):** Mobile-first, fast, Instagram-worthy but authentic. Modern aesthetic, not "mystical." Real photos, real stories.

**Serious Practitioner (30-60):** Authentic Tibetan elements, lineage imagery, information-rich. Credibility over cool factor.

## Portugal Retreat Center Positioning

> "Authentic practice without compromise" - more profound than a luxury resort, higher quality than a rustic monastery.

Needs: architectural renderings, site photography, sustainability narrative, Portuguese cultural integration, rural revitalization story.

## Design Principles

1. **Authenticity Over Polish** - Real over perfect
2. **Clarity Over Complexity** - Intuitive hierarchy
3. **Beauty Without Superficiality** - Quality without commercialization
4. **Tradition Meets Innovation** - Ancient wisdom, modern interface
5. **Inclusive Yet Specific** - Welcoming to all, rooted in lineage

## Risk to Avoid

> "The greatest risk is not failure to reach a large audience, but success in reaching the wrong audience, or the right audience with the wrong message."

Root design in nature, simplicity, and authentic photography. No stock cliches, no "wellness industrial complex" aesthetics, no spiritual bypassing.
