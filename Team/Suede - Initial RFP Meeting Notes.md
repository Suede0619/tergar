# Tergar Retreats RFP - Meeting Prep

**Meeting:** Tuesday | **Presenter:** Dr. Robinson | **My Connection:** Collaborated on "The Heart Illuminated" illustrations

## 5 Key Topics for Discussion

### 1. Platform Recommendation: WordPress vs Squarespace

**RFP mentions:** "Recommend platform & architecture (WordPress, Squarespace (have template), or other) with an eye toward: ease of upkeep, future flexibility, integration with booking system (Retreat Guru), integration with donation systems"

**My Input:**
- **Recommend WordPress with ENFOLD theme** over Squarespace
- **Why:** Nonprofit donation tools (GiveWP), Retreat Guru integration flexibility, superior SEO (critical for limited marketing budget), platform ownership (no vendor lock-in), future scalability (member portal, online courses, multilingual)
- **Squarespace limitations:** Requires Commerce plan ($52/mo vs $33/mo) for full donations, limited booking integration, slower SEO, vendor lock-in, constraints future growth
- **Cost comparison:** Similar 5-year cost (~$2,835 WordPress vs $3,120 Squarespace), but WordPress delivers more features
- **Ease-of-use concern addressed:** ENFOLD drag-and-drop builder + 1-2 hour training (included in scope) = manageable for non-technical staff

**Question to ask:** What's Tergar's current platform, and what are the biggest pain points with the existing site?

### 2. March Deadline Feasibility & Team Consolidation

**RFP states:** "Major deadline for grants in March" + "Initial deliverables (Website + Collateral): Feb-March 2026" = **10 weeks from project kickoff**

**My Input:**
- **March deadline is aggressive** for discovery + website rebuild + full collateral suite with multi-person team (coordination overhead)
- **I can consolidate 3 critical roles:** Web Developer + UX/UI Designer + Graphic Designer
- **Advantage:** Eliminates design-to-dev handoffs, no multi-team sync meetings, single point of accountability = faster execution
- **Frees budget:** More resources for specialized marketing/PR/copywriting (roles that truly need dedicated specialists)
- **Proven track record:** Built RaidGuild website (multi-stakeholder UX), MetaCampus retreat center pitch deck (capital campaign collateral), 30+ WordPress sites

**Question to ask:** What specific deliverables are absolutely critical for the March grant deadline? (Website? Collateral? Both?) Can we prioritize phased delivery if needed?

### 3. Donation Integration Requirements (Critical for Capital Campaign)

**RFP asks for:** "High-trust donation page design, seamless integration with donation/payment tools, Gift Pyramid graphics, Donor cultivation one-pager"

**My Input:**
- **Capital campaigns need robust donor management:** Recurring donations (monthly sustainers), donor database (track major donors), campaign progress tracking (gift pyramid thermometer), offline donation tracking (checks/wire transfers), tax-deductible receipts
- **WordPress solution:** GiveWP plugin ($0-199/year) = purpose-built for nonprofits, includes all features above
- **Squarespace limitation:** E-commerce workaround, no native donor management, requires separate CRM (Salesforce), limited recurring donation tracking
- **Have experience:** Built donation integrations, understand secure payment systems, can create custom gift pyramid visualizations

**Question to ask:** Does Tergar have existing donor database/CRM? How are offline donations (checks, wire transfers) currently tracked? What donation platforms are they currently using or considering?

### 4. Mission Alignment & Retreat Center Understanding

**RFP emphasizes:** "Alignment with mission and values" + "Translate contemplative, lineage-rooted vision into accessible donor-facing and participant-facing language"

**My Unique Qualifications:**
- **Direct relationship:** Collaborated with Dr. Robinson on "The Heart Illuminated" book illustrations (contemplative architecture, sacred space design) = trust established
- **Retreat center experience:** Built MetaCampus pitch deck (retreat center capital campaign), managed Mystical Yoga Farm in Guatemala (infrastructure, hospitality, teacher trainings, private retreats)
- **Buddhist practice (25 years):** Shambhala Training Levels 1-2 (Tibetan Buddhist lineage), 10-day Vipassana retreat (India), Zen Buddhist Training, 6 months living in ashrams/monasteries (India/Nepal: ISKCON Mumbai, Amma's Ashram Kerala, Kathmandu gompas, Annapurna/Everest treks)
- **No learning curve:** Understand Tibetan lineage (Rinpoche title, lineage transmission), retreat participant psychology (curiosity → commitment), environmental stewardship, donor communication for contemplative organizations

**Question to ask:** What aspects of the Tergar/Mingyur Rinpoche story are most compelling to current donors? What messaging has resonated in early fundraising conversations?

### 5. Retainer Scope Clarity & Role Specialization

**RFP requests:** "Ongoing retainer support (April-Dec 2026): Copywriting, graphic design, content creation, social scheduling, PR coordination, podcast booking, reporting & analytics" + "Tiered retainer models"

**My Input:**
- **RFP asks for "fractional marketing department"** but $2k-6k/month retainer realistically supports 1-2 specialists, not full department
- **Suggest role specialization:**
  - **My strength:** Web dev, UX/UI, graphic design, website updates, visual content (social graphics, infographics, presentation design)
  - **Need dedicated specialists for:** Marketing strategy, PR/media relations, copywriting, podcast booking (these require industry relationships + dedicated focus)
- **Proposed division:** I handle technical/design execution, RaidGuild or partner agency provides marketing/PR/copywriting strategy
- **Budget efficiency:** Consolidating web/design roles frees $3k-5k initial budget for specialized marketing talent during retainer phase

**Question to ask:** During retainer phase, which is higher priority: ongoing website updates/design support OR active PR/podcast outreach? This helps determine if budget should weight toward technical or marketing specialist.

## My 30-Second Positioning (If Asked)

"I can consolidate the Web Developer, UX/UI Designer, and Graphic Designer roles. I've already worked with Dr. Robinson on 'The Heart Illuminated' book illustrations, built a retreat center capital campaign pitch deck (MetaCampus), managed a yoga retreat farm in Guatemala, and have 25 years of Buddhist practice including Shambhala Training and 6 months in India/Nepal ashrams. I recommend WordPress with ENFOLD theme for donation integration flexibility, SEO performance, and long-term platform ownership. 30+ WordPress sites built, proven capital campaign collateral design, and the March deadline is feasible with consolidated execution."
