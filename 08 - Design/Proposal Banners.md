## Banner 1: Cover - "Transmitting the Dharma in a Digital World"

**Concept:** "Bridge Between Worlds"
- Horizontal split: traditional monastery (left, desaturated) blending into modern wireframe/Portugal architecture (right)
- Subtle mandala at center blend (5% opacity), thin gold vertical center line
- Warm tones (left) to cool tones (right), gold where they meet

- Dharmic: Trungpa's "bridge between East and West," mandala as complete view

## Banner 2: Context - "The Age of Attention Extraction Meets Mind Training"

**Concept:** "Chaos to Clarity"
- Left: fragmented overlapping rectangles (browser windows, feeds) in chaotic arrangement
- Right: single circle of calm water/clear sky (pristine awareness)
- Subtle declining attention span graph in background, simplified brain scan upper-left
- Colors: attention reds/oranges (left) calming to soft blues/white (right)
- Dharmic: Klesha to shamatha to vipashyana journey; circle = kadag (primordial purity)

## Banner 3: Landscape - "Where Tergar Stands Apart"

**Concept:** "Middle Way Position"
- Mountain path photograph (Himalayas or Portugal), golden hour
- Subtle Venn diagram: "Tradition" (maroon) + "Innovation" (blue) = "Tergar" (gold center)
- Positioning chart: Secular-Traditional axis, Accessible-Rigorous axis, Tergar centered
- Dharmic: Madhyamaka, prajna/upaya union, Mahamudra-Dzogchen union

## Banner 4: Our Approach - "Practitioners Building Viral Communities"

**Concept:** "Sangha Meets Web3"
- Network visualization forming mandala structure
- Center: aerial shot of meditation group in circle, digital connections radiating outward
- Deep blue-black (#1A1A2E) background, saffron-to-blue gradient lines, gold nodes
- Dharmic: Sangha as Three Jewels, Indra's net = decentralized network, "practitioners" not "users"

## Banner 5: Who We Are - "Born Into the Lineage, Built for the Future"

**Concept:** "Generations of Practice"
- Three-panel flow: B&W 1970s dharma pioneers | Color 1990s-2000s | Modern vibrant practitioners with tech
- Gold timeline ribbon flowing through all panels (1970s > 2000s > 2025)
- Right panel: team members in natural contemplative settings
- Dharmic: "Swans Coming to the Lake" (Rick Fields), lineage transmission, generational continuity

## Banner 6: What We Offer - "The Deliverables"

**Concept:** "Three Pillars of the Campaign"
- Blueprint/wireframe aesthetic, three vertical sections:
  1. Digital Infrastructure (blue #2C4F7C) - wireframe mockups, device frames
  2. Campaign Collateral (gold #DAA520) - layered doc mockups, gift pyramid
  3. Marketing & Visibility (saffron #E8B04B) - social feeds, content calendar
- Each pillar shows timeline/hours/outcomes. 108 hours per team member (auspicious).
- Dharmic: Three pillars = body/speech/mind, 108 = auspicious, blueprint = pure land planning

## Banner 7: Portfolio - "From Crypto to Compassion"

**Concept:** "From Tokens to Teachings"
- Split showcase: Top row Web3 work (RaidGuild, token dashboards, campaigns). Bottom row dharmic work (MetaCampus, Heart Illuminated, Tergar mockup).
- Journey path connecting top to bottom with metrics overlay
- Tech blues/purples (top) transitioning through gold to earth tones (bottom)
- Dharmic: Samsara to nirvana journey, "skin in the game" in both worlds

## Banner 8: Structure - "Partnership in Generosity"

**Concept:** "The Offering Bowl"
- Soft gradient deep blue (bottom) to light sky (top)
- Stylized offering bowl (line art, gold #DAA520) containing glowing value exchange elements
- Timeline ribbon below: Phase 1 Jan-Mar 2026, Phase 2 Apr-Dec 2026, March grant deadline highlighted
- Investment shown as: Phase 1 $25,012 | Phase 2 $6K/month | Total $79,012
- Dharmic: Patra (offering bowl), dana (generosity) not pricing, interdependence

---

## Cross-Banner Continuity

1. **Gold Thread:** 2px gold line on every banner = lineage transmission thread
2. **Breath Pattern:** Gradient overlays pulse darker (edges) to lighter (center), 5-10% opacity
3. **Sacred Geometry Grid:** Golden ratio underlying proportions
4. **Narrative Arc:** Introduction > Understanding > Approach > Team > Evidence > Partnership (mirrors view/meditation/conduct/fruition)

---

## OG Design Rationale

- Dharmic literacy assumed (Mahamudra, Dzogchen, dana, kadag used without explanation)
- Lineage references signal we're not dharma tourists
- No lotus cliches, no stock "bliss" photos
- "Practitioners" not "users," "offering" not "pricing," "sangha" not "community"
- Sacred numbers (108), three pillars (body/speech/mind), offering bowl imagery
- Goal: *"These people get it. They're not just marketers - they're practitioners who happen to be excellent at marketing."*
