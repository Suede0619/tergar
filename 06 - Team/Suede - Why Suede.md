## Why This Works

**Speed:** No learning curve (WordPress expert, retreat center experience, Buddhist background) + design-dev integration = March deadline achievable

**Budget:** 3 roles → 1 = more resources for marketing/PR/copywriting

**Quality:** Senior-level design + senior-level development + authentic mission understanding

**Trust:** Dr. Robinson already knows my work

**Commitment:** 9-month retainer partnership, mission-aligned beyond the paycheck
