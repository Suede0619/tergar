# BrightWeb Comparison & Meeting Arc

## What They Said About BrightWeb

The competitor is almost certainly Briteweb — a B Corp certified creative agency focused on social impact organizations, with offices in Vancouver, Toronto, and Brooklyn. They specialize in branding, web design, campaigns, and publications for nonprofits. Notable clients include Arts Midwest, Restore Justice, and similar mission-driven orgs.

### What Tergar LIKED About BrightWeb
- **Nonprofit experience.** Matt: "We have nonprofit experience, looks great, it feels like a great team vibe for us. They have a bunch of sort of sites under their belt."
- **Vibes.** Matt: "10 out of 10 recommend them. Like love the vibes."
- **Feels safe.** They've already had multiple meetings with BrightWeb and seem comfortable with them as a conventional choice.

### What Tergar DIDN'T Like / Had Concerns About BrightWeb
- **Too expensive for the website.** Matt: "We don't need to spend that much money. It's like a basic Squarespace or basic WordPress build. It just needs to look nice."
- **Campaign collateral also pricey.** Matt: "Campaign collateral — like it's a little pricey over there."
- **No dharma/practice background.** Zak said it explicitly: "BrightWeb doesn't have a person on their team who has 25 years of living in community and operating it." This was the pivotal moment that triggered this meeting.
- **No brand strategy depth for this context.** They're a solid nonprofit agency, but they lack the insider understanding of Buddhist organizational dynamics — the mandala structure, donor fatigue across sangha orgs, the secular/traditional dual-path challenge.

## What They Said About Our Team

### What Tergar LIKED
- **Mission alignment and lived experience.** This was the big differentiator. Zak: "Miky and Suede's backgrounds are really perfect. There's a lot of experience here." The dharma practice backgrounds, the community-building experience, the fact that Mikyo tracks Rinpoche's lineage through family connections.
- **Brand strategy chops.** The lion's share of the meeting was about brand — and Mikyo led that conversation with a fluency BrightWeb can't match in this domain.
- **Cost efficiency.** Matt and Zak literally talked through the math: "two thirds of the scope, we're saying, let's just give it to Miky and Ian and Suede."
- **No junior handoff.** Suede: "We're going to be doing the work. We're not going to be handing it off to junior level people."
- **Flexibility.** Team showed willingness to piecemeal, advise, or take the full scope.

### What Tergar Was CAUTIOUS About
- **Aggressive timelines.** Zak: "some of your timelines compared to other ones that we got were — they're aggressive."
- **Capital campaign specific experience.** Matt pressed directly: "how much experience do you guys have supporting capital campaigns specifically?" This wasn't fully answered with a direct analog.
- **Web3/crypto association.** Matt asked the hard question about how the crypto background translates. It's a question mark they needed addressed, and Zak helped bridge it, but it lingers.

## The Piecemeal Discussion

### Phase 1 — Could we split the work?
Zak opened: "trying to figure out if maybe there's other opportunities to work together or piecemeal some of this stuff." Matt revealed the internal math: BrightWeb is too expensive for website + collateral, and our team has the backgrounds they want. So they started wondering: give BrightWeb part, give us part?

### Phase 2 — What would each team own?
- Zak asked directly: "are you guys open to a different scope of work than we bid on, or is this all or nothing?"
- Ian said the team is comfortable being plugged into specific workstreams.
- Suede said he prefers working with this team but is open to working with an outside team.
- Mikyo drew a clear line: "if that's not a part of it [brand strategy], I don't think I'm as useful, candidly." He positioned brand strategy as his irreplaceable contribution — if they just need a website, Suede can ship it, but the real value is the strategic layer.

### Phase 3 — Where it landed
By the end of the meeting, the piecemeal idea was still on the table but unresolved. Key detail: Matt confirmed "We haven't talked about it with them [BrightWeb]. We just looked at their proposal and we're like, I wonder if we could." They'd need to pitch BrightWeb on a reduced scope, which they haven't done.

### The Implicit Conclusion
The meeting started as a vetting call and ended with Tergar clearly leaning toward our team for the strategic and creative core of the work. The piecemeal option felt more like a fallback than a preference — a way to manage risk. The energy of the conversation was about whether our team could own the whole thing, not about how to divide it.
