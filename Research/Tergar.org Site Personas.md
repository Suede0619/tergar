# Tergar.org: Who the Primary Website Serves
## A Brief Persona Analysis of the Existing Tergar Digital Presence

This document describes the audiences currently served by tergar.org -- the main Tergar Meditation Community website. This is distinct from the retreats website we'd be building. Understanding who tergar.org already serves helps us design the retreats site to complement rather than duplicate, and shows the Tergar team that we've studied their existing ecosystem.

---

## Site Overview

Tergar.org is the digital home of the Tergar Meditation Community, founded by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. It serves a global audience across 30+ countries, 108 meditation groups, and 20+ languages. The site functions as a learning platform, community hub, event calendar, and donation gateway.

The site is structured around Tergar's eight-level path: three levels of **Joy of Living** (secular) and five levels of **Path of Liberation** (Buddhist/Vajrayana). This dual-path architecture is the organizing principle of the entire digital experience.

## Persona 1: The Curious Newcomer

**Who they are:** Someone who has heard of meditation, possibly tried an app, and is looking for something more structured or authentic. They may have found Tergar through a Google search ("how to meditate"), a Mingyur Rinpoche book (*The Joy of Living*), his Netflix appearance (*The Mind, Explained*), or a friend's recommendation.

**What the site offers them:**
- "Intro to Meditation" free course (email-based, daily video teachings, guided meditations)
- Anytime Anywhere Meditation (AAM) -- condensed Joy of Living for busy schedules
- Joy of Living Level 1 Discover Cohort -- six-month guided program with live sessions
- Language that is explicitly non-religious: "a path of meditation that anyone can follow, regardless of religious or cultural orientation"
- Rinpoche's personal story of overcoming panic attacks as an entry point of relatability

**How the site speaks to them:** Warm, accessible, solution-oriented. "You're not the only one." "Over 500,000 people have discovered that true and lasting happiness does not depend on the outer circumstances of your life." Low barrier: free offerings, email signup, no jargon.

**What they need:** Permission to begin. Reassurance that this isn't religious indoctrination. A clear first step. Community without pressure.

## Persona 2: The Active Student (Joy of Living Path)

**Who they are:** Someone already enrolled in or progressing through Joy of Living Levels 1-3. They're developing a regular meditation practice, attending online courses, and possibly connecting with a local Tergar group. They may or may not identify as Buddhist. They're committed but still exploring.

**What the site offers them:**
- Self-paced Joy of Living online courses (Levels 1-3)
- Live cohort programs with guides and facilitators
- Community workshops and practice groups (108 groups worldwide)
- Meditation Tracker app
- Monthly teachings and blog content from Rinpoche
- Local community group directory (dozens of cities across North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa)

**How the site speaks to them:** Encouraging, structured, community-oriented. "We grow together." The path language is progressive -- calming the mind, opening the heart, developing wisdom -- giving students a sense of advancement without pressure.

**What they need:** Clear progression. Community connection. Regular access to teachings. A sense of belonging and forward movement in their practice.

## Persona 3: The Committed Practitioner (Path of Liberation)

**Who they are:** A dedicated student who has completed Joy of Living and chosen to pursue the Buddhist path. They're studying Mahamudra, engaging with Vajrayana teachings, and deepening their relationship with Rinpoche as a teacher. This is no longer casual -- it's central to their life.

**What the site offers them:**
- Path of Liberation (5 levels of Mahamudra study and practice)
- Vajrayana Online teachings
- Events with Mingyur Rinpoche (in-person and online, globally)
- Tergar Lamas and senior instructors
- Lineage history and context

**How the site speaks to them:** More traditional Buddhist language appears at this level -- "nature of mind," "pure awareness," "Mahamudra." The tone shifts from accessible invitation to something more direct and devotional. The relationship with the teacher becomes central.

**What they need:** Depth. Access to advanced teachings and qualified teachers. In-person events with Rinpoche. A sense that their commitment is met with substance. Eventually: retreat opportunities (which is where the new site comes in).

## Persona 4: The Aspiring Teacher

**Who they are:** An experienced Joy of Living student who wants to teach meditation in their own community. They may be a therapist, educator, yoga teacher, or community leader who sees meditation as integral to their work. Or they may simply want to serve the Tergar sangha.

**What the site offers them:**
- Meditation Teacher Training Program (year-long certification)
- Instructor and facilitator pathways
- A directory of existing Tergar Guides, Instructors, and Facilitators (modeling what they could become)
- Community group infrastructure to plug into

**How the site speaks to them:** Professional but mission-driven. The teacher training is positioned as service, not career advancement. The emphasis is on being qualified to share the teachings authentically.

**What they need:** A credible certification pathway. Clarity on requirements and time commitment. Connection to the existing teacher network. Assurance that they'll be supported after training.

## Persona 5: The Existing Donor / Supporter

**Who they are:** Someone who already gives to Tergar, whether it's a modest recurring gift or a significant annual contribution. They believe in the mission and want to support access to meditation for others. They may be a practicing student or simply a supporter who values the work.

**What the site offers them:**
- Donate page with multiple giving options (online, check, wire, stock, crypto, DAF, planned giving/bequests)
- GuideStar and Charity Navigator ratings (4 stars) for credibility
- Mission-aligned framing: donations support "boundless awareness, compassion, and wisdom"
- Legacy giving with sample will clauses and formal brochure
- Prayer requests (a unique offering that deepens the sense of personal connection)

**How the site speaks to them:** Grateful, mission-focused, transparent. Giving is framed as participation in a larger purpose, not a transaction. The range of giving vehicles (crypto, DAF, planned giving) signals organizational sophistication.

**What they need:** Trust that their gift is well-used. Easy giving mechanics. Recognition without ostentation. A sense that their support matters.

## Persona 6: The Global Community Member

**Who they are:** A Tergar student or sympathizer anywhere in the world -- Kathmandu, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Moscow, Prague, Barcelona. They may not have access to in-person events with Rinpoche regularly. Their primary relationship with Tergar is digital and through their local meditation group.

**What the site offers them:**
- 20+ language support (EN, ES, DE, FR, PT, RU, and more)
- Local community group directory spanning 30+ countries
- Online teachings and self-paced courses accessible globally
- Inclusion statement explicitly naming language, nationality, and cultural barriers
- Events in multiple countries and time zones

**How the site speaks to them:** Inclusive, globally aware. The inclusion statement is translated into multiple languages. The site acknowledges "social, physical, financial, and cultural barriers" and frames inclusion as mutual enrichment.

**What they need:** Access despite geography. Content in their language. Connection to the global community. A sense that Tergar is not just an American organization.

## What This Means for the Retreats Site

The primary Tergar website already does several things well:
- Welcomes newcomers with low-barrier, secular entry points
- Structures a clear progression from beginner to advanced
- Serves a genuinely global, multilingual audience
- Maintains a warm, non-dogmatic tone while preserving authentic lineage depth
- Provides multiple giving pathways for existing donors

**The retreats site we're building occupies a different space.** It serves audiences that tergar.org doesn't fully address:

| tergar.org Handles | The Retreats Site Handles |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Online learning and community | Physical place and immersive experience |
| Ongoing practice support | Capital campaign and fundraising for the center |
| Global meditation groups | A specific retreat center in Portugal |
| Existing students and donors | New donors, grant officers, and first-time retreatants |
| The path as curriculum | The path as lived, embodied experience |

The retreats site should feel like it belongs to the same family as tergar.org -- same lineage, same warmth, same accessibility -- but with its own identity. It's not a subsection of the main site. It's the physical manifestation of the vision, and it needs to feel that way.

**Key design principle:** A visitor should be able to move between tergar.org and the retreats site and feel they're in the same world, but the retreats site should carry the weight of place, aspiration, and generosity that a capital campaign demands.
