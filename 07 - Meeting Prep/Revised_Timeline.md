## Revised Timeline Summary

The original 9-week timeline didn't account for **5 rounds of internal Tergar reviews**. We're proposing an extended **12-week timeline** that maintains the March 31 grant deadline while building in proper review cycles and feedback integration periods.

**Key changes:**
- Extended from 9 to 12 weeks
- 5 formal review rounds (5-7 business days each) built into schedule
- Sequential approach: strategy → content → design → development
- 2-week development buffer for testing and training
- Grant-ready materials delivered March 31

**Critical success factors:**
- Designate single Tergar point person to consolidate feedback from all 5 internal reviewers
- Pre-schedule all review windows now
- Maintain 5-7 day maximum per review round
- Weekly 30-minute sync calls to maintain momentum
